# qeli — one-shot server installer. During the run it asks which profile to deploy
# (reality-tls default, fake-tls, or udp-quic) and which port to listen on (default :443).
#
# What it does, end to end:
#   1. installs dependencies,
#   2. gets qeli onto the box AND sets up everything the .deb does (the `qeli` user,
#      /etc/qeli + state dirs, *.conf.example files, the systemd unit, the polkit rule):
#      by default it downloads + installs the latest .deb from GitHub Releases; with
#      QELI_BIN=<path> it installs that prebuilt binary and reproduces the same layout
#      itself (add QELI_SRC=<repo checkout> for a fully offline / build-from-source run),
#   3. asks for the profile (reality-tls | fake-tls | udp-quic) + listen port and writes
#      /etc/qeli/server.conf with ONLY that profile (taken from the packaged
#      multi-profile example) on the chosen port, full-tunnel NAT on,
#   4. generates the server identity key,
#   5. creates 5 users and saves their ready-to-use qeli:// connection strings
#      under /etc/qeli/client-links/,
#   6. enables + (re)starts the service.
#
# It is a FIRST install: if /etc/qeli/server.conf already exists it refuses to run,
# because rewriting that file mints a new REALITY short_id and kills every qeli://
# link already issued. To upgrade an installed server use update-qeli-server.sh;
# QELI_FORCE_RECONFIG=1 (below) overrides, keeping a timestamped backup.
#
# After it finishes you only paste/scan a connection string into the app.
#
# Usage (run as root — directly, or via sudo if you have it; sudo is NOT required
# and is never installed):
#   ./install-qeli-server.sh [PUBLIC_HOST]          # when already root
#   sudo ./install-qeli-server.sh [PUBLIC_HOST]     # when sudo is available
#     PUBLIC_HOST   Address clients connect to (IP or hostname). If omitted, the
#                   public IP is auto-detected — pass it explicitly if your box has
#                   separate inbound/outbound IPs or you use a domain.
#     QELI_PROFILE  Optional. Single-profile install (legacy). If unset, ALL profiles
#                   from server-multiprofile.conf.example are enabled (default).
#     QELI_SINGLE_PROFILE=1
#                   Force single-profile mode without setting QELI_PROFILE.
#     QELI_PANEL_DOMAIN=<hostname>
#                   Panel behind an external TLS terminator (nginx). Sets loopback
#                   bind, tls=false, secure_cookie=true, allowed_origins=<hostname>.
#                   With all profiles, reality-tls listens on 127.0.0.1:4430 for nginx
#                   SNI passthrough on public :443.
#     QELI_PORT     Optional. Pick the listen port non-interactively (default 443;
#                   1-65535, and not 8080 which the web panel uses). udp-quic listens on UDP.
#     QELI_BIN      Optional. Path to a prebuilt qeli binary — install from it and
#                   reproduce the .deb layout instead of downloading a .deb.
#     QELI_SRC      Optional. Path to a repo checkout; with QELI_BIN, copy the exact
#                   unit / examples from it (offline). Without it they are taken from the
#                   SHA256-verified .deb of the release that matches the binary.
#     QELI_REF      Optional. Release tag to take that unit / those examples from
#                   (default: v<the version `qeli version` reports>).
#     QELI_RUN_AS    Optional. OS user the service runs as: `qeli` (default,
#                   unprivileged, least-privilege) or `root`. `root` removes privilege
#                   separation — only pick it when the qeli user cannot work (a kernel/
#                   container without ambient capabilities) or to avoid the /etc/qeli
#                   ownership + polkit setup. Applied via `qeli set-service-user`.
#     QELI_FORCE_RECONFIG=1
#                   Required to run against an EXISTING /etc/qeli/server.conf. The
#                   installer REWRITES that file from scratch and mints a new REALITY
#                   short_id, which kills every qeli:// link already handed out. With
#                   the opt-in set, the old config is backed up with a timestamp first.
#     QELI_PANEL_PUBLIC=1
#                   Publish the web panel on 0.0.0.0 instead of loopback. REQUIRES
#                   QELI_PANEL_ALLOWED_IPS=<ip[,ip…]> (the panel's source-IP allowlist).
#                   Default: loopback only — reach it over an SSH tunnel.

# Everything this script creates is either a secret or config for a secret, so default to
