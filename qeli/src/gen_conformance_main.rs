//! Generator for the shared cross-language KAT fixtures under `conformance/`.
//!
//! WHY THIS EXISTS: the production transport is now the shared Rust core, but retained C#
//! and Swift wire primitives still consume these fixtures for compatibility and regression
//! coverage. Before the unification, every shared primitive was another chance to disagree,
//! and the failure mode was silent — M6 (the counter-derived data-plane nonce) shipped
//! inconsistently for a whole release because nothing compared the implementations.
//! Each fixture's `platforms` list identifies the implementations required to consume it.
//!
//! The vectors are PRODUCED BY THE CANON, never hand-written: a hand-computed vector only
//! proves that the author and the code agree on the same mistake.
//!
//! Usage:
//!   cargo run --features conformance-gen --bin gen-conformance            # write the files
//!   cargo run --features conformance-gen --bin gen-conformance -- --check # CI: fail on drift
//!
//! `--check` regenerates in memory and compares against what is on disk, so a fixture can
//! never quietly drift away from the implementation it is supposed to pin.
//!
//! NB: lives at `src/gen_conformance_main.rs`, NOT `src/bin/` — `.gitignore` carries
//! `**/bin/`, which would silently keep this file out of git (same reason as
//! `src/client_main.rs`).
