// ── fault injection: does the routing layer actually fail CLOSED? ────────────
//
// Everything below drives `setup_routes` / `cleanup_routes` with a FAKE `ip` on PATH.
// That is the point: the interesting behaviour here is "we ran a command and interpreted
// its result", and the failures that matter are the ones where the command did NOT work —
// which a healthy machine will not produce on demand. With a shim these tests need no
// root, no TUN and no network, because nothing real is ever configured.
//
// The shim records every invocation, so a test can assert not just the outcome but
// exactly WHICH commands ran. That is how "cleanup removes only what it created" is
// checked — something no amount of end-to-end testing on a healthy box would reveal.
