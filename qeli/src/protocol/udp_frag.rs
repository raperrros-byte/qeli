//! App-layer fragmentation for the large UDP handshake messages.
//!
//! The post-quantum UDP handshake is big: the ClientHello carries the ML-KEM-768
//! encapsulation key (1184 B) → ~1440 B, and the ServerHello+Certificate+Finished
//! carries the ML-KEM ciphertext (1088 B) + cert chain → ~1959 B. A single ~2 KB
//! UDP datagram is IP-fragmented by the network, and mobile / CGNAT paths routinely
//! DROP IP fragments — so the fragmented ServerHello never reassembles and the UDP
//! handshake silently hangs (works on Wi-Fi, fails on LTE).
//!
//! Fix: split those two messages ourselves into <=[`MAX_CHUNK`]-byte fragments, each
//! in its own datagram that never needs IP fragmentation, and reassemble them at the
//! peer.
//!
//! Three messages are fragmented, and the third only sometimes. The ClientHello and the
//! ServerHello always are — they are always too big. The **AuthOK** ([`MSG_AUTH_OK`]) is
//! fragmented only when it exceeds [`MAX_CHUNK`], which happens when the profile pushes
//! enough routes; below that it goes out as the single unframed datagram it always was, and
//! that boundary is what keeps peers predating `MSG_AUTH_OK` working. The client's AUTH is
//! never fragmented — instead the credentials that make up its size are bounded at config
//! load (`config::client::ClientConfig::check_credential_size`).
//!
//! Layering: this sits on the cleartext handshake message, BELOW the QUIC-mask and
//! obfs-XOR transforms — each fragment datagram is independently QUIC-wrapped / XORed.
//!
//! Wire: `[MAGIC(3)][msg_id(1)][idx(1)][count(1)][chunk...]`. `MAGIC` cannot open a
//! TLS record (`0x16 0x03`), so a backward-compatible server distinguishes a
//! fragmented ClientHello from a legacy single-datagram one and replies in kind.
