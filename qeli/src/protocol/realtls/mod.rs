//! `realtls` — a hand-rolled, byte-grade browser TLS 1.3 stack for true REALITY
//! (Ось 1, см. `docs/DESIGN-remaining.md`). Unlike `protocol::tls` (fake-TLS: a
//! browser-*ish* ClientHello followed by the qeli protocol), `realtls` emits a
//! Chrome-exact ClientHello and (M2.2+) carries the tunnel inside a genuine
//! TLS 1.3 session.
//!
//! The stack now contains the Chrome-grade ClientHello/JA4 builder, HKDF key
//! schedule, AEAD record layer, async and sans-IO client handshakes, and both
//! rustls-backed and hand-rolled server termination paths.
//!
//! The REALITY authenticator is unchanged from M1: the 32-byte token from
//! [`crate::crypto::reality::seal_session_id`] is placed in the TLS
//! `legacy_session_id`, and the ephemeral X25519 public key is the `key_share`.

// round-trips where a pointer is 64 bits wide (see registry.rs). Compile it only there.
// The GUI clients that consume the cdylib — Windows, macOS, Android arm64/x86_64, iOS —
// are all 64-bit, so they are unaffected; the 32-bit ROUTER builds (mipsel Keenetic,
// armv7 OpenWrt) never call the FFI at all and previously only compiled it by accident.
// Without this gate the guard inside registry.rs fails those builds outright, which is
// how mipsel/armv7 stopped building in 0.7.12 despite shipping in every release before.
