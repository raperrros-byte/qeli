 * `addresses` is the authoritative inner-address set. `tunnel_address`, `prefix_len` and
 * `tunnel_gateway` remain a legacy projection of its primary entry for older platforms;
 * an ABI 1.11 platform must apply every supported family in `addresses`, routes and DNS as
 * one generation. `carrier_address` is the already-resolved outer server address that must
 * remain outside a full tunnel. The leak flags are authenticated exceptions used only when
 * a full-tunnel plan omits that address family; false means the platform must capture or
 * block the missing family fail-closed.
 * A platform must apply or reject the complete generation before packet flow starts.
 * Unknown additive fields must be ignored; changing an existing field's meaning requires
 * a new ABI major version.
