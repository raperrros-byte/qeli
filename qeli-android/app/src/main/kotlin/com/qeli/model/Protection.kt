 *
 * * [routes] is CAPPED at [ROUTE_SAMPLE] entries with [routeCount] carrying the real total.
 *   A server may advertise an arbitrarily long list — an operator pushing a country-sized
 *   prefix set is a normal thing to do — and the detail sheet builds a view per row with no
 *   recycling. Capping at the source keeps both the snapshot and the sheet bounded instead
 *   of hoping the list stays short.
 * * the session token is NOT here and must never be: it is the credential that authorises a
 *   bonded stream to join this session.
