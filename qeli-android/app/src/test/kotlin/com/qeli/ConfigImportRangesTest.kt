/**
 * Range checks on IMPORTED numeric config values. (Audit 2026-07-27, C6)
 *
 * The server-PUSHED mtu was already clamped at the handshake (QeliService.parseOk), but the
 * locally imported one was not: a hand-written `mtu = 40`, or a scanned
 * `qeli://…?mtu=99999`, went straight through to VpnService.Builder.setMtu, where establish()
 * fails and the retry loop reconnects forever behind an opaque error. Padding was the same
 * bug one layer down — an oversized `padding_max` makes every data record exceed
 * the shared Rust record-size limit, so the peer drops all of them.
 *
 * The two entry points behave DIFFERENTLY on purpose, mirroring the Rust client
 * (qeli/src/config/client.rs) and the C# port: a config FILE is a thing the user wrote, so a
 * bad value is reported; a `qeli://` LINK is scanned or pasted and its import is infallible,
 * so a bad value degrades to auto. Getting these the same way round on every client is the
 * point — the divergence is what the conformance work keeps finding.
