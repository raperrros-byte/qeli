# Client roaming (seamless network change) — implementation plan
<!-- normative-sync: roaming-v47-platform-gates-only -->

> **Status: design complete; Phases 0–2A and the shared Phase 2B TCP handover are

> discarded the old socket before retry expiry, and the server saw challenge/commit only on C with
> exactly one published commit. PID/TUN and traffic survived without reconnect. The Windows/macOS
> C# and iOS Swift path executors are now source-complete; their device/race acceptance and Phases
> 4–6 remain. The iOS Rust slice passes strict `aarch64-apple-ios` cross-target Clippy, while Xcode
> and physical-device NetworkExtension acceptance remain. A deterministic commit-race scenario passed
> 24/24: after server
> PATH_COMMIT(B), local COMMIT(B) route mutation was delayed while the detector observed C, but the
> serialized executor prevented C from cancelling or overtaking B. B's exact ACK/publication completed
> before PREPARE(C), after which C committed exactly once; PID/TUN and traffic survived without reconnect.
> A deterministic control-loss scenario passed 18/18: firewall counters proved that the first

> both losses, and the server replayed PATH_COMMIT without a second path publication or reconnect.
> The Linux IPv4 roaming PMTU slices passed 19/19 each. Bare probes and ACKs are routed after exact
> committed CID/epoch/socket/peer classification instead of being discarded as failed AEAD records.
> A symmetric move from MTU 1500 to 1280 independently re-certified both directions from 1461 to
> 1161 bytes, retained the inner TUN MTU 1400, and carried a 1350-byte payload through DATA_FRAG.
> An asymmetric C2S 1500 / S2C 1280 gate kept uplink at 1461 while the server descended the shared
> PMTU ladder and certified downlink at 1161; reverse DATA_FRAG, PID/TUN, and the session survived.
> A deterministic Linux IPv4 receive-drain gate passed 26/26. Both directions on old path A used
> MTU 1280 with a three-second delay and gap reordering; path B committed while each 1350-byte
> DATA_FRAG record was incomplete. The exact previous epoch/peer/socket/CID remained receive-only

> rejected. Duplicate DATA_FRAG on active path B remained idempotent without replacing PID/TUN or
> reconnecting.
> A dual-listener Linux outer-family gate passed 32/32. One authenticated session moved
> IPv4 → IPv6 → IPv4 through distinct receiving workers without another AUTH or reconnect, while
> retaining its codec owner, PID, and TUN. Each direction independently re-certified PMTU
> 1461 → 1341 → 1461, a DATA_FRAG-sized packet crossed the IPv6 leg, and each commit left exactly

> remain restricted to the committed peer.
> A deliberate bidirectional DATA_FRAG-loss Linux gate passed 25/25. With both paths at outer MTU
> 1280, the firewall dropped exactly the first full-size fragment of each 1350-byte record while

> A deterministic same-network NAT dead-mapping Linux gate passed 21/21. Stateless translation moved

Goal: when the client's IP/interface changes (Wi-Fi↔LTE, cell handover, new DHCP
lease) the **user's connections do not drop**. The real traffic rides on the tun-IP,
which is preserved, so the inner flows are insulated from the outer-path change — the
job is to keep the **outer** tunnel alive (or rebuild it instantly) without losing
the session or paying Argon2 again.

## 0. Seamlessness per transport

| Transport | Achievable | How |
|---|---|---|
| **UDP** (fake-TLS / QUIC masking / obfs / AWG) | Fully seamless after `UDP_ROAM_V1 + DATA_FRAG_V1` negotiation | All modes switch after AuthOK to one directional-CID envelope; PATH_CHALLENGE/PATH_RESPONSE validation commits the peer address |
| **TCP** (reality-tls / fake-tls / obfs / plain) | Seamless with make-before-break; otherwise a short gap | Multipath JOIN over the new network *before* the old dies; fallback — grace + JOIN-resume |
| **raw plain** | TCP only | The current protocol has no separate raw-plain UDP profile |

**Non-goals:** zero byte loss on a hard handover where only one network is alive at
the moment of transition (inner-TCP retransmit covers it); MPTCP; buffering +
re-encrypting un-flown downstream packets (not worth the complexity).

## 1. Current pre-roaming behavior

Without `experimental-roaming`, a network change still means **fast reconnect, not roaming**:
the client detects the change, performs a **full new handshake** (ephemeral X25519+ML-KEM plus a
fresh Argon2 login); the server supersedes its previous session by **device-id** and hands back the
same tun-IP (the pool is sticky by `device_key`) and routes. The Android feature TCP adapter instead
turns the physical callback into a bounded PathUpdate and uses full reconnect only as fallback.
The default result remains a ~(RTT + Argon2 time) dip and packet loss in the window.
Roaming removes that hiccup.

## 2. Protocol / wire design

### 2.1 UDP connection-id (CID) — demux by packet content

Today the legacy QUIC-masked mode picks one stable four-byte CID, while unmasked fake-TLS/obfs
has no pre-auth CID. In either case the server demuxes an established legacy session by source
`SocketAddr`; an address change is a map miss and causes a full handshake.

Change: after authenticated `UDP_ROAM_V1` negotiation every UDP camouflage mode atomically switches
to the same rotating eight-byte destination-CID envelope. It sits outside the session PacketCodec,
because the server has to identify the session before selecting that session key, but inside any
profile-wide UDP obfs transform: fake-TLS and QUIC masking expose the CID-shaped header, whereas
obfs/AWG seals it with the profile obfs key before it reaches the physical wire. Its flags retain
the ordinary QUIC-short shape, but this roaming demux envelope does not require the legacy `quic`
masking option and adds no fixed qeli-specific marker. On an
address miss the server attempts the eight-byte registry lookup, while a known legacy path
continues to use its recorded four-byte form.

### 2.2 CID rotation (unlinkability) — mandatory

A constant cleartext CID that survives a network change is a **correlation tell**: a
passive observer links your Wi-Fi to your LTE. So the CID **rotates**, as in QUIC.
Adopted design — **deterministic rotation (Design B):**

```
roam_cid(n) = HKDF-Expand(session_secret, "qeli-roam-cid" ‖ LE64(n))[..8]
```

- `session_secret` — derived from the same ECDH secrets as the data keys (via a
  separate HKDF label), known only to the endpoints.
- `n` — the path epoch, incremented on each migration. On the original path `n=0`.
- For a candidate path the client selects `roam_cid(n+1)`; the server keeps a **sliding
  window** of bounded current/previous/future CID aliases. A packet from an unknown
  address whose CID is expected and passes AEAD+replay creates only a bounded candidate.
  The active CID and monotonic path epoch advance only after return-path validation and
  atomic PATH_COMMIT.

Properties: the on-wire CID differs per path (anti-link), the derivation is
deterministic (no CID-pool exchange), the server precompute is bounded by the window.
**8 bytes wide** (vs today's 4) — for collision safety; this is a wire change to the negotiated
roaming header ([protocol/roaming.rs](../../../qeli/src/protocol/roaming.rs)). Every UDP mode uses
it only after mutual authenticated capability opt-in; legacy sessions remain byte-for-byte
unchanged (real QUIC CIDs may be up to 20 bytes).

> Alternative (Design A, QUIC-style "CID pool"): the server hands the client a set of
> future CIDs in advance (encrypted, post-auth). More flexible, but more state and
> protocol. Rejected in favor of deterministic rotation as simpler and stateless.

### 2.3 Migration trigger & validation (anti-hijack)

The server **does not update** the active peer address merely because a packet matched an
expected CID and passed AEAD plus replay checks. Those checks authenticate the session
and permit creation of one bounded candidate path; they do not prove that the sender owns
the return path. An attacker without the key cannot create a candidate, and an
authenticated but unusable/spoofed return path cannot become active without the
challenge/response transaction below.

**QUIC-style path validation is mandatory in the first production version.** A packet
with an authenticated next CID creates only a bounded candidate path. The server sends
PATH_CHALLENGE within a 3× anti-amplification budget, waits for PATH_RESPONSE, and only
then atomically commits downstream to the candidate. Stale epochs, duplicate challenges,
parallel candidates, and late responses from an old path must not roll back the active
path. AEAD plus replay protection authenticates the session; challenge/response proves
that the peer also owns the return path.

### 2.4 TCP: JOIN-resume + grace period

The outer TCP socket can't migrate — but there's a ready primitive, the **JOIN token**
(stream bonding): a new TCP connection from the new IP does its own handshake and sends
`JOIN(session_token)` instead of AUTH → the server attaches it to the live session
(same tun-IP, routes, **no second Argon2**). What's missing:

1. **Grace period.** Today, when the last stream detaches the session is torn down
   **immediately** ([handler.rs](../../../qeli/src/server/handler.rs)): `by_ip`/`by_token`
   cleared, IP returned to the pool. Needed: on last-stream detach, mark the session
   `orphaned_at = now` and **keep** it for `roaming.grace_secs`; a JOIN in that window
   revives it (for `max_streams=1` the check passes: 0 < 1,
   [handler.rs](../../../qeli/src/server/handler.rs)).
2. **Authenticated JOIN is mandatory from the first production version.** The existing
   token is only a session locator and never a bearer credential. A new key exchange
   creates fresh AEAD keys, while a proof binds the resume secret, transcript hash,
   session locator, wide resume epoch, logical slot id, and handover flag. A repeated
   proof, a proof for another slot/epoch, or a modified transcript is rejected. A leaked
   locator alone is therefore insufficient to resume a session.
3. **Anti-DoS caps.** Orphaned sessions **still count** against `max_clients` and the
   per-user limit during grace; cap `roaming.max_orphaned`. Otherwise connect→drop
   churn accumulates dangling sessions and exhausts the IP pool/slots (directly against
   the anti-ghost-session work already done).

### 2.5 TCP make-before-break (the seamless path)

When the new network appears **before** the old dies (typical Wi-Fi→LTE, both briefly
up), the client **proactively** opens a JOIN stream **over the new network**; the
scheduler ([server/mod.rs](../../../qeli/src/server/mod.rs) `pick_stream`/`flow_hash`) shifts
flows only after the new logical slot is ready, then drains the old stream. Existing
multipath is a foundation, not a complete implementation: the server and shared core
still need authenticated JOIN proof, stable logical slots, the generation-scoped path
transaction, bounded queues, and race-safe JOIN/reaper/kick ownership. The client also
needs exact per-interface socket binding (see 4.4).

## 3. Server implementation (Rust)

### 3.1 UDP demux ([udp_handler.rs](../../../qeli/src/server/udp_handler.rs))
- A secondary index `cid_index: HashMap<[u8;8], SocketAddr>` next to the primary
  `HashMap<SocketAddr, UdpClient>`. The primary stays the fast path (most packets come
  from a known address), with no per-packet cost change.
- `handle_udp_datagram`: (1) lookup by address — as today; (2) miss + valid roaming short header →
  unwrap → CID → lookup in `cid_index` (incl. the expected roam-CID window) → candidate
  session → trial-decrypt with its `rx_codec` → if Ok and replay-ok, enqueue PATH_INIT
  for the per-session actor and create at most one bounded **CANDIDATE**.
- The actor sends PATH_CHALLENGE under the 3× anti-amplification budget. Only a valid,
  epoch-bound PATH_RESPONSE may perform atomic PATH_COMMIT: switch the active address,
  receiving/egress socket and outer family, rotate bounded CID aliases, reset PMTU, then
  drain the old receive path. An abort removes only resources owned by that candidate
  generation.
- Replace the writer's captured address/socket with actor-owned `ActiveUdpPath`; every
  egress send reads the committed path. This must represent IPv4 and IPv6 without a
  packed-IPv4 shortcut.
- **Crypto state is preserved** (codec, counter, replay window) — that's the whole
  point of seamlessness.

### 3.2 TCP grace + JOIN-resume ([handler.rs](../../../qeli/src/server/handler.rs))
- In `run_stream` (teardown, `was_last`): instead of immediate removal, mark
  `orphaned_at = Some(now)`, keep it in the maps.
- A reaper (extend the existing cleanup tick) removes orphaned sessions older than
  `grace_secs` (then release IP/token).
- The JOIN path on attach: clear `orphaned_at` (session revived).
- New field on `SessionShared`: `orphaned_at: Mutex<Option<Instant>>`.

### 3.3 Flat-INI config and panel
User-facing server settings are profile-scoped:
```ini
[profile:mobile-udp]
roaming.enabled = true
roaming.grace_secs = 30
roaming.max_orphaned = 256
roaming.max_orphan_bytes = 67108864
```

Client policy is part of `[qeli]`:
```ini
[qeli]
roaming = auto
```

Allowed values are `off` (always reconnect), `auto` (roam when safely negotiated,
otherwise reconnect), and `required` (fail if safe roaming is unavailable).
Low-level cryptography, path validation, anti-amplification, PMTU reset,
and CID rotation are protocol invariants, not operator switches.

### 3.4 PMTU and DATA_FRAG after roaming
A new path can have a smaller outer MTU and otherwise black-hole large records. The first
production version resets the outer payload budget to the safe minimum for the new family
after PATH_COMMIT and starts a bidirectional live PMTU probe bound to path epoch, source,
and egress socket. Old-path measurements and late ACKs cannot raise the new budget.
DATA_FRAG_V1 keeps the existing inner TUN/TAP MTU and NetworkPlan unchanged.

## 4. Client implementation (all five applications)

Rust (Linux/OpenWrt), Android (Kotlin), Windows and macOS (shared C# layer), and iOS
(Swift platform adapter) all use the same Rust session supervisor and path transaction.

### 4.1 Network-change detection
- **Rust** (Linux/router): netlink `RTM_NEWADDR`/route monitor, or poll the default route.
- **Android**: best-matching non-VPN Network callback (full reconnect fallback) —
  repurpose for the soft-rebind.
- **Windows**: `NetworkChange.NetworkAddressChanged` / `NotifyAddrChange`.
- **macOS**: `nw_path_monitor` / `SCNetworkReachability`.

The Android feature TCP adapter now submits bounded, generation-scoped PathUpdates, resolves through
the exact `Network`, binds and protects the candidate socket, and publishes `setUnderlyingNetworks`
only after COMMIT. Stale generations and superseded Networks cannot mutate platform state. Same-network
NAT rebinding/dead-mapping detection remains.

### 4.2 UDP soft-rebind (the seamless path)
On a network change: create a **new** UDP socket on the new interface, **keeping** the
existing `PacketCodec`/counter/CID state; advance the roam-CID epoch; resume sending.
**Critical: do NOT recreate the codec** — that's nonce reuse (catastrophic for AEAD).
Architecturally — a single session-state object that survives socket replacement.

### 4.3 TCP make-before-break
- "New network available" (both up): open a JOIN stream bound to the new interface;
  after the ack, mark the old stream draining; the old dying → no gap.
- "Only the new network" (hard handover): the old stream is already dead → JOIN-resume
  over the new within the grace window; grace expired → full reconnect (today's path).

### 4.4 Per-interface socket binding
Android `Network.bindSocket`; Linux `SO_BINDTODEVICE` (the client is root for TUN
anyway); Windows `IP_UNICAST_IF` (or bind to the interface address); macOS
`IP_BOUND_IF`.

## 5. Security (summary)
- **Anti-hijack:** AEAD+replay may create a candidate; mandatory return-path validation
  and atomic PATH_COMMIT are required before downstream or the active address changes.
- **Anti-linkability:** CID rotation (UDP). The TCP token is in-tunnel, no wire tell —
  but the **server** sees both IPs under one session (as it already does via device-id),
  and a global observer correlates by timing/volume. This residual is now documented in
  `THREAT-MODEL.md`; CID rotation is not presented as an anonymity guarantee.
- **Anti-DoS:** grace/orphaned caps; orphaned counts against limits; UDP migration is
  O(1) lookups; CID aliases, candidates, and anti-amplification are bounded.
- **Nonce reuse (the #1 footgun):** the client must carry the codec **verbatim** across
  the rebind — assertion + test.
- **MTU blackhole:** re-probe / conservative default.

## 6. Testing & lab
- **Unit:** roam-CID derivation/rotation KATs; migration accept/reject (a valid packet
  migrates, a spoofed/replayed one doesn't); grace timer; JOIN-resume attach at
  `max_streams=1`.
- **Fuzz:** extend [qeli/fuzz](../../../qeli/fuzz) along the CID/migration path.
- **e2e on the lab (.10/.11):** a script flips the client's src-addr mid-flow.
  `roaming_udp_all_modes_netns_e2e.sh` runs the same success gate for QUIC, fake-TLS, obfs, and
  obfs+AWG; each must retain the session with zero reconnects. TCP uses make-before-break with
  two live networks and JOIN-resume <grace on a hard handover; measure gap/loss/"Argon2 skipped".
- **Regression:** throughput unchanged (the CID lookup runs only on an address miss,
  not per packet).

## 7. Phasing

No production stage may expose roaming without authenticated JOIN proof, path validation,
anti-amplification, PMTU reset, and bounded DATA_FRAG/reassembly.

- **Phase 0 — ✅ source complete:** capabilities, CONTROL_V2, KDF labels, proofs, wire
  limits, and KATs are frozen behind the internal compile gate used by supported builds.
- **Phase 1 — ✅ source complete:** ABI 1.12 provides bounded generation-scoped
  PathUpdate plus PREPARE/BIND/COMMIT/ABORT, V3 roaming telemetry, strict correlation,
  lifecycle cleanup, and mock fault injection. ABI 1.13 adds the capability-gated same-path
  refresh request without changing the fixed event/stats prefixes. Linux handles it in-process;
  Android returns a snapshot of the unchanged `Network`. Other native adapters do not advertise
  the bit and retain reconnect fallback.
- **Phase 2A — ✅ lifecycle source complete:** the shared core owns the
  Active/Orphaned/Resuming/Closing/Revoked state machine, dual orphan session/byte limits,
  generation-tagged reaper ownership, monotonic resume-epoch consumption, stable logical
  slots, atomic JOIN reservation, and make-before-break draining. Unit tests cover stale
  proof/transcript/epoch/locator rejection, JOIN-vs-reaper, revoke-vs-JOIN, exact-once
  release, cap exhaustion, abort, and late drain acknowledgements.
- **Phase 2B — 🟡 shared TCP resume/handover complete; Linux and Android feature live accepted:** the Linux handler
  and shared client supervisor derive and zeroize the original-session resume secret, strictly
  parse authenticated resume JOIN, reserve before JOINOK, and use a fresh KE plus fresh
  per-carrier data keys on every attach. The feature client core can advertise `CONTROL_V2`,
  `TCP_RESUME_V2`, and `TCP_HANDOVER_V2`, but negotiation requires the complete platform contract.
  Linux advertises it only for feature TCP without a fixed source; Android advertises it only for
  TCP when the loaded feature core reports the path-transaction ABI.
  Loss of the last carrier preserves the same TUN and NetworkPlan for a 30-second grace and
  retries the same stable logical slot once per second; sibling reader/writer tasks share a
  persistent stop signal. The server permits one bounded authenticated candidate above the
  stream cap so a hard resume can atomically replace a stale carrier before server-side EOF/RST
  detection, then drains and closes the obsolete transport. Orphan session/byte limits and the
  generation-scoped reaper remain the fallback when every server-side carrier has detached.
  Legacy JOIN/scheduling remain unchanged for non-negotiated sessions.

  Intentional client stop now sends a strict empty single-part `CLOSE_SESSION` inside the
  authenticated PacketCodec/`PACKET_MUX_V1` path. The client forces a pending recordizer batch
  to flush and waits at most 750 ms for socket write completion; the server atomically blocks new
  JOIN/resume admission, closes every bonded stream, releases the lease immediately, and never
  enters orphan grace. Linux SIGINT/SIGTERM uses this cooperative cancel path instead of
  bypassing data-plane destructors with `process::exit`.

  The make-before-break foundation now binds the authenticated resume proof to an explicit
  handover bit and reference-counts overlapping carriers for each stable logical slot. Draining
  the old carrier therefore cannot make the replacement appear absent. Server negotiation also
  requires the authenticated client to advertise both TCP handover core bits and the complete
  platform `ROAMING_PATH` contract (`PATH_TRANSACTIONS + PATH_SOCKET_BINDING`); claiming the core
  bit alone cannot authorize replacement of a live transport.

  The shared supervisor now consumes one ACK-confirmed PREPARE candidate at a time, creates a
  separate unbound socket, requires exact platform `BIND_SOCKET` before connect, and dials only
  the A/AAAA addresses supplied by that PathUpdate. A fresh-KE authenticated handover JOIN is
  validated before `COMMIT_PATH`; only after its ACK does the new carrier replace stable slot 0.
  Overlapping carriers retain the slot by refcount, and the committed address set becomes the
  repair source for the remaining bonded slots. BIND/COMMIT/ABORT have correlated oneshot results,
  a 45-second bound, and cancellation on supersede/stop. Before `COMMIT_PATH` issuance, candidate
  failures remain rollbackable. After issuance, only an explicit platform rejection permits
  rollback; an ACK timeout, cancellation, closed waiter, or late/failed ACK terminates the current
  generation for full reconnect. Android takes that terminal path immediately if the OS commit
  succeeded but local bookkeeping or JNI acknowledgement failed.

  An unsupported peer is rolled back with an ACK-confirmed ABORT before the normal full-reconnect
  fallback. Candidate connect/JOIN failures also abort temporary platform state. A COMMIT rejection
  is fail-closed: because the server has already authenticated and switched the carrier, the client
  recovers through the existing authenticated hard-resume path instead of publishing an uncommitted
  local path. Android enables `ROAMING_PATH` for feature TCP and all UDP modes, and advertises
  `PATH_REFRESH` only when an ABI 1.13 core exposes the matching core capability.
  Windows, macOS and iOS advertise both path capabilities for ordinary profiles when the feature
  core exposes the matching ABI. On iOS, `NWPathMonitor`, interface-scoped endpoint resolution,
  Darwin socket binding and exact carrier `excludedRoutes` execute the same transaction. Explicit
  `local`/non-zero `lport`, default/old cores and unsupported peers retain reconnect fallback.

  Lab `.10` passes the final default/feature suites (865/910 library tests, 4 CLI,
  7 integration; one privileged test ignored in each configuration) and strict all-target
  Clippy for both builds. An isolated Linux netns e2e with an asymmetric TCP RST passes 13/13:
  resume completes in 2 seconds, the outer carrier changes, TUN ifindex/address survive,
  traffic recovers, and password AUTH occurs exactly once. A separate `.11 → .10` live test with
  required `PACKET_MUX_V1` passes 3/3 tunnel pings, observes both close markers, leaves zero
  established carriers and no client TUN, and confirms that the server did not enter resume
  grace. Those `.10/.11` results cover hard resume and explicit close.
  A permanent `resume` netns case now reproduces a server-side carrier reset on unchanged path A:
  exactly one authenticated JOIN completes within grace without a second AUTH, top-level reconnect,
  or PID/TUN replacement; the live result is 18/18. Its paired `grace-expiry` case configures a
  three-second server grace, blackholes replacement carriers until locator reap, requires exact
  `unknown locator` rejections with no JOIN commit, then waits out the 30-second client resume
  budget and accepts only an ordinary full reconnect, second AUTH, and restored traffic; its live
  result is also 18/18. This is a deterministic short/expired transport-grace gate, not a substitute
  for physical-device suspend acceptance. The two-path Linux
  feature e2e now also passes 15/15: path B completes authenticated JOIN/COMMIT, path A can be
  removed, the same PID/TUN survive, and 150/150 probes pass without a top-level reconnect.
  Android API 34 emulator acceptance covers both directions: Wi-Fi hard loss selects an already
  available cellular Network and retains 198/200 probes; cellular-to-Wi-Fi make-before-break retains
  200/200. The same process, VPN Network, `tun0`, and `NetworkPlan 1` survive, with exactly one
  `Auth OK`. Sleep/wake on the unchanged Network retains 160/160 probes without an unnecessary
  handover, and system DNS still resolves after both transitions and sleep.

  `scripts/roaming_android_sleep_wake_gate.py` now makes that unchanged-path acceptance
  reproducible and fail-closed for any already-connected TCP or UDP profile, without carrying a
  profile or credentials. It saves and restores the AVD's Doze flags and screen state, requires
  actual deep `IDLE`, runs continuous tunnel probes, and after wake compares the application PID,
  `/proc/net/if_inet6` TUN identity and address while rejecting any new AUTH or NetworkPlan. The
  complete API 34 matrix with the 0.8.0 feature APK passed for `fake-tls`, `quic`, `obfs`, and
  `obfs-awg`: every mode remained in deep idle for 20 seconds, retained 180/180 probes and the same
  PID/`tun0`, resolved `example.com` through the server-pushed tunnel resolver after wake, and
  emitted only the same-network keep marker. Each temporary server then stopped without leaving
  its port or TUN behind. Parser regressions cover the real one-line `dumpsys deviceidle` flag
  format. This repeatable emulator gate does not replace physical-device suspend/NAT acceptance.

  `scripts/roaming_android_udp_grace_expiry_gate.py` adds a separate credentials-free, fail-closed
  acceptance gate for UDP roaming-grace expiry on any already-connected experimental profile. It
  accepts only an executable `apply|restore` fault hook, never invokes it through a shell, and always
  restores the fault, Doze flags, and screen state on every exit path. The gate requires real deep
  `IDLE`, keeps the previous path unavailable beyond the negotiated grace, then enforces the ordered
  same-network soft recovery → transport fallback → exactly one new AUTH → exactly one applied
  NetworkPlan sequence. After a full reconnect it locates the replacement TUN by its exact assigned
  address rather than the unstable `tun0` name; the application PID must remain unchanged.

  The complete API 34 feature-APK matrix passed for `fake-tls`, `quic`, `obfs`, and `obfs-awg`: the
  old UDP path was blackholed bidirectionally for 40 seconds with a shared 15-second grace and no
  endpoint restart. All four modes recovered 5/5 tunnel pings and DNS through the server tunnel
  resolver. This emulator gate proves the shared policy across all UDP adapters, but does not replace
  physical-device suspend/NAT acceptance.

  The shared TCP supervisor now always yields generic slot repair to an already-prepared exact-path
  candidate and, after the last carrier disappears, gives a handover-enabled platform a bounded
  one-second PathUpdate preparation window. If no candidate materializes by then, ordinary hard-resume
  proceeds; recovery is never deferred indefinitely. This removes the observed Android sequence in
  which generic hard-resume and exact-path handover replaced slot 0 back-to-back. A repeated API 34
  race gate recorded exactly one authenticated JOIN for Wi-Fi-to-cellular hard loss and one for the
  reverse make-before-break transition, retained 76/80 and 80/80 probes respectively, kept the same
  PID/VPN Network/`NetworkPlan 1`, ran AUTH once, and still resolved DNS names. The full Rust library
  suite passed 931 tests with three ignored; strict all-target Clippy and Android release `-D warnings` passed.

  Real devices, platform-specific same-network NAT rebinding, Windows/macOS/iOS device/race
  acceptance, iOS Xcode/NetworkExtension compilation, and the broader
  transport/family/NAT64/per-app/race/soak matrix remain.
- **Phase 3 — 🟡 registry/migration, server egress, and client validation foundations source-complete:** a
  profile-wide bounded table now owns generation-tagged sessions, up to three deterministic CID
  aliases, directional zeroized secrets, one authenticated candidate, exact path challenge/response,
  3× anti-amplification accounting, atomic collision-safe CID rotation, generation-tagged PMTU reset,
  stale-probe rejection, and exact cleanup. A generic bounded cross-worker fabric keeps immutable
  home-worker ownership of each session codec, avoids a global decrypt lock, uses no channel hop for
  local ingress, and uses fail-closed `try_send` for other `SO_REUSEPORT` workers. Unknown CID,
  invalid worker, full and closed mailbox outcomes are distinct, and rejected payloads retain exact
  ownership without `Debug`.

  The authenticated server UDP writer now snapshots the exact socket, peer, framing, path epoch,
  and matching PMTU budget once per complete encrypted record. An experimental guarded commit can
  atomically publish the next IPv4/IPv6 path and eight-byte CID without replacing the PacketCodec,
  replay window, rate buckets, or TUN ownership. A stale commit cannot roll the path back; a late
  old-path `EMSGSIZE` cannot overwrite the new family's safe budget; and DATA_FRAG subtracts the
  actual legacy or roaming header length. The legacy four-byte-CID wire path remains byte-identical.
  Thirteen focused unit tests cover sequential rotations, stale/collision/anti-amplification,
  local/cross-worker/full/closed routing, and atomic writer publication.
  Heartbeat and shaping-cover records now take the same per-record active-egress snapshot, so a
  committed path supplies their exact socket, peer, and CID. A record already snapshotted may finish
  on the draining path, but subsequent records observe the commit. A reverse PMTU probe is built for
  the active framing, sent from the active socket to the active peer, and bound to the exact path
  epoch and address. Its pending marker is shared with the timeout task, so changing the session's
  address-map key cannot strand the retry gate. ACK certification checks epoch and peer while the
  active-path read guard is held; an old-path ACK therefore cannot widen the new path's budget.

  The UDP bootstrap contract is now fail-closed and additive. Entry requires explicit authenticated
  opt-in from both peers to `CONTROL_V2 + UDP_ROAM_V1 + UDP_DATA_FRAG_V1`; a client cannot activate
  a reserved capability that the server did not advertise. For a negotiated QUIC session, encrypted
  AuthOK carries `udp_roaming_session` as a non-zero `u64` encoded by exactly 16 hexadecimal
  characters. The client rejects a missing or malformed identifier once negotiation succeeds, while
  the legacy AuthOK builder omits the field byte-for-byte. Three focused tests cover negotiation,
  canonical emission/legacy omission, and strict parsing.

  Feature UDP handshakes now use the shared `SessionKeyMaterial`: existing data keys remain
  identical, while directional C2S/S2C CID secrets come from the same hybrid or static-bound KDF
  and remain zeroizing. Before AuthOK can advertise a fully negotiated session, the server records
  its exact initial worker/path, epoch-zero CIDs, and family-safe payload budget in one profile-wide
  registry; the client independently derives the matching directional CIDs from the session id.
  A non-cloneable generation-scoped registration guard owns cleanup, so late teardown of an old
  session cannot remove a replacement's aliases. Worker ids are now unique across every
  `bind.listen` of the profile, preparing unambiguous cross-listener and cross-family delivery.
  Two focused lifecycle tests pin the stale-owner/replacement and shared-fabric races.

  The server hot path now creates one bounded fabric across every profile worker/listener and gives
  each worker one non-cloneable mailbox. It checks an eight-byte short-header CID before new-session
  rate limiting, but enters the roaming path only after the full CID resolves. The shared first byte
  is not treated as a discriminator, so an unknown CID from a known address retains legacy handling
  and a repeated AUTH can still recover a lost AuthOK. The pooled datagram moves without copying
  together with the exact receiving socket to the immutable home worker. A generation-safe
  `session_id → address` index is published only after AUTH and removed transactionally with the
  address map; stale teardown cannot delete a replacement generation.

  The owner boundary now feeds the encrypted record through the session's existing PacketCodec,
  replay window, and bounded DATA_FRAG reassembler. Only a single-part, flag-free client
  `PATH_INIT` or `PATH_RESPONSE` can cross the strict CONTROL_V2 decoder. Replays, malformed or
  fragmented control, server-direction messages, ordinary data, and unauthenticated bytes are
  rejected before the TUN and before any path state can change. Candidate liveness advances only
  after successful AEAD verification. Two focused tests pin the direction/shape gates and shared
  replay-window behaviour.

  An authenticated `PATH_INIT` now validates the next epoch, future C2S CID, expected S2C CID,
  and new socket/peer under one profile-registry operation. It creates or idempotently finds the
  session's sole candidate with a non-zero 128-bit token. `PATH_CHALLENGE` uses the shared TX
  PacketCodec and verified eight-byte destination CID, then leaves through the exact receiving
  socket. Its cumulative budget is reserved before send and includes the roaming header plus obfs
  overhead; it cannot exceed 3× the conservatively counted authenticated candidate ingress. The
  generation-scoped ticket remains in the session actor for the following PATH_RESPONSE slice.

  The guarded commit state transaction now prepares the complete next CID/PMTU outcome before
  changing registry state and calls a synchronous external socket/address publisher while holding
  the profile-registry lock. CID aliases, active epoch, PMTU generation, and candidate ownership
  change only after publication succeeds. A publisher failure leaves the candidate retryable, and
  an invalid challenge no longer increases the anti-amplification budget. A focused regression test
  pins this rollback. The last successful commit is retained as one bounded exact
  ticket/path/epoch/token outcome per session. A freshly encrypted retry of that PATH_RESPONSE
  returns the same PATH_COMMIT decision without invoking the publisher, rotating CIDs, or resetting
  an already refined PMTU; a mismatching token or path still fails closed. A second focused test
  pins the idempotent replay.

  The live server handler now authenticates PATH_RESPONSE against the retained candidate, validates
  the old epoch and peer, and synchronously places PATH_COMMIT on the candidate socket before it
  exposes the new socket, peer, CID, epoch, or family-safe PMTU. `WouldBlock` and any other socket
  publication failure leave both registry and writer state unchanged and the candidate retryable.
  After success, the address map and generation-safe owner index move together under the directory
  lock. Session-limit, supersede, and teardown cleanup resolve the current owner by session id rather
  than the connect-time address. An exact fresh-encrypted PATH_RESPONSE retry sends PATH_COMMIT again
  without rotating CIDs or resetting PMTU; a different token, path, old peer, occupied destination,
  or stale epoch fails closed.

  Post-commit DATA and DATA_FRAG now enter the existing authenticated UDP uplink path. Before AEAD,
  the owner classifies the routed CID against the writer snapshot under the directory lock: a
  previous or farther-future epoch is rejected without consuming replay state, the current epoch
  requires the exact committed socket and peer, and only the next epoch may reach candidate control.
  After one session-wide decrypt, ordinary records use the existing bounded DATA_FRAG reassembler,
  recordizer, source guard, destination ACL, bandwidth pacing, accounting, MTU/client-info control,
  and TUN forwarder. Candidate DATA is rejected; only authenticated path control may use that path.
  Commit, teardown, and DATA therefore cannot observe a partially moved directory/egress state.

  A fully negotiated epoch-zero session now publishes its initial server-to-client CID directly in
  `UdpActiveEgress`, so writer PMTU/recordizer budgets are computed for the 13-byte roaming header
  from the first post-auth record. AuthOK and its cached retransmit deliberately retain the legacy
  four-byte QUIC framing: the client must receive AuthOK before it knows the session id from which
  both directional CIDs are derived. The ingress owner rejects every routed CID until all AuthOK
  fragments have been sent and `auth_ok_sent` is published, preventing an early candidate from
  committing over the epoch-zero bootstrap. Default and non-negotiated wire output remains unchanged.

  Candidate validation is now independently bounded per profile. A candidate has a fixed ten-second
  lifetime, the profile retains at most `min(max_clients, 1024)` candidates, and a sliding one-second
  admission window permits at most 64 new candidates. An idempotent retransmit of the same
  authenticated PATH_INIT adds only its bounded ingress accounting: it neither refreshes lifetime nor
  consumes another rate slot. Expired tickets fail before egress/commit, while the existing server
  maintenance tick reaps silent candidates. Commit, abort, CID collision, session teardown, and
  expiry update the exact shared count.

  A cross-listener IPv4-to-IPv6 regression now routes the future CID from a foreign receiving
  worker to the immutable codec owner, commits that exact candidate socket/family and PMTU
  generation, then verifies that post-commit ingress still returns to the original owner.

  The shared client state machine now owns directional CID derivation/rotation, the next epoch,
  platform-candidate and CONTROL_V2 message correlation, and the complete `PATH_INIT →
  PATH_CHALLENGE → PATH_RESPONSE → PATH_COMMIT/PATH_ABORT` validation sequence. A zero challenge,
  wrong CID/epoch/direction, parallel candidate, or stale platform completion fails closed. An exact
  duplicate challenge idempotently resends the response. Retransmission is capped at four datagrams
  at 500 ms intervals inside the same fixed ten-second lifetime as the server candidate. A received
  wire commit is only a proposal: active epoch/CIDs do not change until the platform has acknowledged
  `COMMIT_PATH`, so a late completion after ABORT cannot publish an old path. Eight focused tests pin
  these invariants; strict feature Clippy and the full feature library suite (943 passed, three
  ignored) pass.

  The shared client wire layer now produces the complete `CONTROL_V2 → PacketCodec → eight-byte
  CID` envelope and parses authenticated packets with the session's one replay window. It treats
  ordinary data as data while requiring each marked `PATH_*` control to be flag-free, complete and
  single-part. Android, Apple and desktop adapters therefore cannot grow different CID/control
  grammars. Round-trip, data/control separation, fragmented-control rejection and replay tests cover
  that boundary.

  The transport-facing platform contract is now the protocol-neutral `PathController`. A shared Unix
  UDP candidate dialer creates one unbound socket, waits for the exact candidate's `BIND_SOCKET` ACK,
  and only then connects to the first family-compatible address resolved by that PathUpdate. The
  Linux test exercises the same bind-before-connect contract for both TCP and UDP.

  The common client actor now constructs epoch-zero roaming state immediately after AuthOK and
  atomically selects one post-auth framing snapshot. Ordinary data, DATA_FRAG, recordizer output,
  heartbeat/cover, authenticated reports, startup/live PMTU probes and both PMTU ACK directions all
  use that same snapshot. Roaming ingress requires the exact server-to-client CID before consuming
  PacketCodec/replay state; egress uses the client-to-server CID. The data-fragment and PMTU budgets
  subtract the actual 13-byte roaming header instead of the legacy nine-byte header. Legacy masked
  and unmasked paths remain byte-for-byte compatible. Three focused framing tests cover passthrough,
  legacy compatibility and directional-CID rejection.

  Behind `experimental-roaming`, the live UDP actor now consumes a prepared `PathUpdate`, performs
  exact BIND-before-connect through the shared Unix candidate dialer, and starts a separate bounded
  receive pump for the candidate. PATH_INIT and bounded retries use the shared PacketCodec; only
  authenticated PATH_CHALLENGE/PATH_COMMIT/PATH_ABORT with exact CID, message id, and epoch can
  advance the state machine. After peer PATH_COMMIT, the actor first awaits the exact platform
  `COMMIT_PATH` acknowledgement and then publishes the new socket, receive pump, directional CID
  framing, and conservative family-aware PMTU/record budget in one actor transaction. Already queued
  old-epoch packets are rejected, while candidate DATA cannot become active before the new epoch is
  published. Expiry, send failure, peer abort, and teardown release the socket and issue the exact
  platform ABORT. Because the server has already switched by the time PATH_COMMIT is received, any
  local failure after it terminates the actor for a fail-closed full reconnect instead of pretending
  the old path is usable. A focused test pins candidate-to-active receive classification and stale
  epoch rejection; strict default and feature Clippy, the default suite at 871 passed/1 ignored, and
  the feature suite at 952 passed/3 ignored all pass.

  `UDP_ROAM_V1` now activates in `experimental-roaming` for every UDP camouflage mode when the
  server advertises the same bit, authenticated `DATA_FRAG_V1` is present, and the platform provides
  complete `ROAMING_PATH`. Linux and Android no longer duplicate a QUIC-only platform gate; a
  live four-mode matrix passed QUIC, fake-TLS, obfs, and obfs+AWG: 4/4 modes and 68/68 checks
  retained PID, TUN, and the authenticated session without top-level reconnect. Fixed-source configurations,
  disabled profiles, unsupported adapters, and legacy peers retain reconnect behavior. The
  original isolated two-path Linux UDP+QUIC netns e2e passed 17/17 with old-path removal and no PID/TUN replacement or top-level reconnect;
  its paired rollback case passed 20/20 with a path-B-only blackhole, bounded expiry, exact platform
  ABORT, and the carrier `/32`, PID/TUN, and traffic retained on path A without reconnect. A three-path
  supersede gate passed 24/24: B crossed BIND/PATH_INIT, exact ABORT of that old candidate preceded
  PREPARE C, the actor rejected late B proof, and exactly one C commit was published. Adversarial late-
  control and commit linearization now have their first completed race slice. The shared client state
  machine rejects an old message-id challenge/commit after ABORT and stale platform completion cannot
  mutate its replacement. A path transaction may replace only a truly unobserved PREPARE without ABORT;
  an unobserved BIND already follows applied PREPARE state and therefore requires exact ABORT. Once
  COMMIT starts, only the latest new PathUpdate is queued behind its linearized ACK because the server
  may already have switched. The Linux in-process executor serializes emit/consume/OS mutation so a
  concurrent detector cannot steal BIND/COMMIT. Its deterministic live commit-race passed 24/24 with
  exact B→C order, two single commits, unchanged PID/TUN, and no reconnect. The first packet-loss
  slice is also complete: a fixed-length firewall gate dropped exactly the first PATH_CHALLENGE and
  PATH_COMMIT, fresh encrypted retries recovered both, and the 18/18 live gate retained PID/TUN and
  published one commit. The symmetric and asymmetric Linux IPv4 PMTU slices are now complete as well.
  Negotiated bare PMTU control is consumed before PacketCodec decoding only after the directional CID
  resolves the session and the exact committed epoch, receiving socket, and peer match; candidate paths
  remain restricted to authenticated PATH control. Epoch-zero probing certified 1461-byte payload
  budgets in both directions. A bidirectional MTU-1280 carrier independently re-certified 1161 bytes
  in both directions while retaining inner MTU 1400 and carrying a 1350-byte DATA_FRAG payload. On the
  asymmetric gate, C2S stayed at 1461 while an S2C-only 1280 blackhole forced the server down the same
  shared ladder to 1161; a 1350-byte reverse payload crossed through DATA_FRAG. One exact pending marker
  spans the whole descent, so duplicate reports cannot start another scheduler and an epoch/peer change
  cancels it. The Linux IPv4 in-flight receive-drain slice is complete as well. After PATH_COMMIT,
  the exact immediately previous epoch/peer/socket/CID remains receive-only for one DATA_FRAG
  reassembly timeout; old path control and PMTU remain rejected, and expiry releases the old receive
  task/socket snapshot. A deterministic 26/26 gate used MTU 1280 and three-second gap reordering in
  both directions on old path A, committed B while both 1350-byte records were incomplete, then
  completed both records through the bounded drain. Duplicate DATA_FRAG on active B remained
  idempotent, with the same PID/TUN and no reconnect. The Linux outer-family slice is complete too:
  a deterministic dual-listener 32/32 gate moved one authenticated session IPv4 → IPv6 → IPv4,
  retained the codec owner/PID/TUN, re-certified both directions at 1461 → 1341 → 1461, carried a
  DATA_FRAG-sized packet, and removed the stale qeli-owned route after each commit. Continuous traffic
  retained at least 245 of 260 probes without top-level reconnect. The deliberate DATA_FRAG-loss
  slice is complete too: a 25/25 gate dropped one full-size fragment in each direction while retaining
  each tail, committed path B with both records incomplete, then completed new fragmented records in
  both directions after the five-second reassembly timeout and removal of path A. PID/TUN and the
  authenticated session remained unchanged and no reconnect occurred. The deterministic Linux
  same-network NAT dead-mapping slice is complete too: a 21/21 stateless-translation gate changed
  only the server-observed external peer, kept the client path/PID/TUN/session unchanged, emitted one
  `SameNetworkNatFailure` update after authenticated RX silence, and committed one candidate without
  another AUTH or reconnect. Its request/wait/grace/fallback policy is shared Rust state; platform
  controllers supply only a bounded same-path snapshot hook and retain ownership of update IDs.
  Real-device NAT-rebinding and soak gates remain. The Phase 4 Linux/OpenWrt
  adapter now consumes the shared ordered family-compatible candidate projection: a physical path must have
  at least one local/resolved family match, and an unusable leading AAAA/A answer cannot hide a later
  usable address. Native Android/Windows/macOS/iOS runtimes now delegate prepared-candidate lookup,
  BIND/COMMIT/ABORT requests, correlated ACK completion and cancellation to one shared Rust
  `CorePathController`. The Linux in-process adapter now uses that controller and the shared bounded
  `ClientCore`: it executes PathCommands outside the core lock, correlates ACKs, immediately drains a
  mandatory ABORT after rejection, and leaves unrelated lifecycle events queued. Its source-complete
  read-only PREPARE route projection requires each carrier to resolve through the exact
  `from <source> oif <interface>` pair and the FIB must return that physical interface. An isolated
  netns regression proves that source binding plus `SO_BINDTODEVICE` selects the candidate default
  route despite active tunnel `/1` routes and an old carrier `/32`; no temporary route/policy rule
  is therefore needed before authenticated proof. The exact candidate-socket primitive then applies
  `SO_BINDTODEVICE` for the validated interface index and binds a same-family local address (including
  the IPv6 link-local scope). The COMMIT route primitive now preflights the complete address set before
  mutation: matching operator routes remain unclaimed, conflicting operator routes reject the commit,
  and only qeli-journalled routes may be replaced. Every add/replace is verified by an ordinary
  source-aware FIB lookup; a later IPv4/IPv6 failure restores earlier routes in reverse order. Once
  the new route is usable, COMMIT retires only previous qeli-owned carriers absent from the desired
  family set; a retirement failure rolls back the new route and restores already retired routes and
  journal ownership. Active pinning and generation-scoped A/AAAA discovery are separate: alternatives
  remain eligible only for a future authenticated candidate transaction and never enter the active
  bypass or bonded set early. Every TCP wire mode (`reality-tls`, `obfs`, `fake-tls`, `plain`)
  now creates a separate unbound candidate socket, receives BIND acknowledgement before connect, and
  uses only the first compatible address from that PathUpdate. After authenticated JOIN, COMMIT applies
  routes first and only then publishes the new pinned carrier-address set for later bonded streams. An
  unprivileged regression proves that the dialer ignores an intentionally unreachable configured address,
  connects to the candidate address, and binds before connect. Linux observation, capability activation,
  and initial live acceptance are complete. Android TCP exact-Network DNS/bind/protect,
  PREPARE/BIND/COMMIT/ABORT, stale/supersede guards, and Wi-Fi↔cellular plus sleep/wake emulator
  acceptance are complete. The Android source adapter now exposes that same transaction for every
  UDP mode and answers a core-requested same-network NAT refresh without owning retry/fallback policy.
  The complete UDP API 34 feature-APK gate covers fake-TLS, QUIC, obfs and obfs-AWG with a
  same-Network, same-session NAT rebind and no AUTH/reconnect; real-device UDP/NAT-rebinding remains
  pending.
  A repeat gate after a clean build of the current feature core and APK `0.8.0` (`versionCode=720`,
  SHA-256 `710185c288ac0d19e1adfd843d409d8f450270239a5bd241dd91764d996d9ead`) again passed all
  44/44 invariants across the four modes: a new UDP source port, exactly one AUTH and NetworkPlan,
  unchanged application PID/TUN, and 5/5 tunnel ping both before and after commit.
  The native candidate contract now preserves a borrowed signed 64-bit Unix descriptor or Windows
  `SOCKET`, and the same UDP migration actor compiles on Windows. Strict Windows-host and Linux
  all-target feature checks pass; the Windows/macOS C# and iOS Swift path executors are
  source-complete and their live acceptance remains pending. The iOS adapter observes only physical
  `NWPathMonitor` paths, resolves an effective local/remote endpoint on the selected interface,
  protects old+new then new-only carrier addresses with exact NetworkExtension excluded routes,
  binds the borrowed descriptor with Darwin interface/source options and ACKs the same shared
  PREPARE/BIND/COMMIT/ABORT commands used by ordinary TCP and all UDP modes. The feature Rust slice
  passes strict `aarch64-apple-ios` cross-target Clippy; Xcode 16 compilation and physical-device
  Wi-Fi/cellular, wake, NAT64, rollback, per-app/MDM and soak gates remain.
  Linux IPv4 packet delay/reorder/duplicate
  and in-flight receive-drain acceptance, the Linux IPv4↔IPv6 PMTU round-trip, and deliberate
  bidirectional DATA_FRAG-loss are complete. Deterministic Linux same-network NAT dead-mapping is
  accepted in netns. Linux exit-node acceptance is complete for TCP and every UDP camouflage mode;
  real-device race/soak/NAT-rebinding and Windows/macOS/iOS acceptance remain.
- **Phase 4 — 🟡:** Linux/OpenWrt and Android TCP feature adapters are complete at initial
  live-acceptance level; Android UDP is source-complete and its complete emulator NAT-rebinding
  matrix is accepted. Linux exit-node TCP and all-UDP acceptance is complete. The Windows shared
  core plus Windows/macOS/iOS path executors are source-complete; desktop/iOS device and race
  acceptance, iOS Xcode compilation, and real-device soak/NAT-rebinding remain.
- **Phase 5 — 🟢 source-complete:** flat-INI, non-default `qeli://` sharing,
  and all four client models/editors are complete. Windows/macOS/Android/iOS expose
  `Auto / Required / Off`, persist it through their shared platform model, and reject `required`
  with a hidden source pin. The server panel/API exposes the profile-scoped rollout switch,
  defaults new profiles to enabled, and leaves sparse existing profiles disabled for compatibility;
  it also exposes the grace period and bounded orphan session/memory budgets. Read-only control/status and
  the transport-aware dashboard expose worker-lifetime attempts, commits, final failures, TCP grace
  expiry, and pending paths without identifiers or secrets. Control status also exposes only the
  aggregate active UDP CID-alias count for leak detection, never CID values, locators, or proofs.
  Every shipped server profile explicitly enables roaming with safe budgets, and every client
  template explicitly selects `auto`, including the multiprofile installer source, Reality release
  files, Keenetic, and OpkgTun.
- **Phase 6:** full lab matrix, soak, canary profiles, staged rollout, and legacy fallback. A
  representative TCP mode and representative UDP QUIC mode each require 10,000 sequential A/B
  commits. The fake-TLS, obfs, and obfs+AWG UDP wire adapters each require 1,000: all four modes use
  the same UDP actor, so repeating the full endurance count for every camouflage wrapper adds no
  distinct resource-state coverage. The configurable same-session harness still defaults to 10,000
  for an individual TCP or UDP invocation. It checks PID/TUN, AUTH/reconnect, exact routes,
  client/server commits, all fd, a separate socket-descriptor count, and sampled RSS. Sockets are
  bounded at baseline + 2 finally
  and baseline + 8 in samples. Control aggregates require exact attempts/commits and one session;
  TCP requires zero failures/grace/orphan state; UDP requires zero failures/candidates and exactly
  three CID aliases after the first commit (two at epoch zero).
  The 100-migration TCP and all four UDP wire-mode harness
  smokes pass while retaining one authenticated session. The representative Linux TAP gate passes
  TCP fake-TLS 17/17 and UDP QUIC 19/19 while preserving the same TAP, process, and authenticated
  session across the handover; the default TUN regression passes the same 17/17 and 19/19. Both
  Each release candidate uses a bounded mandatory gate of 100 sequential A/B commits for one
  representative TCP mode and UDP QUIC. It retains the strict session/PID/TUN, route, counter,
  CID/orphan-state, fd/socket and RSS checks while completing in minutes rather than roughly
  15 hours. The completed 10k runs remain endurance evidence, and the standalone harness still
  defaults to 10k for nightly runs and major roaming-state changes. Values below 100 are smoke
  only and cannot satisfy release certification.
  device types use the same TCP/UDP roaming state machines and the harness verifies their actual
  kernel kind. The TCP harness also covers `max_streams=1`, fixed bonding, and adaptive bonding.
  A live regression exposed old secondary writers that kept accepting flow-pinned packets after
  slot 0 moved; path COMMIT now retires the complete old carrier set and the shared stable-slot
  maintainer rebuilds the learned width through the committed route. Single passes 17/17, fixed
  passes 21/21, and adaptive passes 22/22 after growing to three streams under real tunnel load;
  restored secondary JOINs originate from path B and the session/TUN survive without reconnect.
  The feature suite passes 973 tests with three ignored, and strict feature/default Clippy passes.
  The UDP all-modes wrapper forwards the same selected case, including `soak`, through
  QUIC, fake-TLS, obfs, and obfs+AWG. A live
  0.8.0↔0.7.14 binary matrix passes 24/24 TCP/UDP checks: current server with legacy client and
  legacy server with current `auto` carry traffic after one full AUTH without entering roaming,
  while current `required` remains pre-TUN and pre-full-AUTH across retries. The corrected
  representative TCP fake-TLS and UDP QUIC 10k gates described below now pass; only the explicitly
  listed physical-device/platform gates remain open.
  An older diagnostic TCP 10k passed every functional/fd check but exceeded the 32 MiB RSS budget.
  Code audit found the lifecycle cause: two or three completed Tokio task handles for every retired
  carrier remained in the generation registry until full tunnel teardown. Registering the next
  carrier now removes only `is_finished()` handles, while active and still-closing tasks remain
  available to teardown. An async regression pins the bounded registry; the full 10k live gate of
  the fixed release+jemalloc binary now passes as well.
  The TCP/UDP soak server-resource probe has also been corrected. The old
  `ip netns pids ... | head -n1` selected the `qeli server` supervisor, while the real data-plane
  fd, sockets, and RSS belong to its `qeli _worker` child. A live audit saw 10 fd, 3 sockets, and
  about 22 MiB on the mistakenly sampled supervisor versus 16 fd, 6 sockets, and about 57 MiB on
  the worker. The shared probe now requires exactly one PID with the same canonical executable,
  `_worker` role, and exact current `-c/--config` argument. TCP and UDP also pin client and worker
  `/proc/<pid>/stat` start ticks, so disappearance, ambiguity, or PID reuse fails closed. The Linux
  contract matrix passes 4/4, and the helper plus both soak cases pass ShellCheck. On fixed SHA-256
  `b8add83126dd1b6c608fa6288b7d227bf377ff3d27ce577db2dab5e114b265dc`, the corrected representative
  TCP fake-TLS 10k passes 15/15 with client/server fd 13/16, sockets 4/6, sampled RSS
  47,284/57,764 KiB, and zero orphan state. Corrected representative UDP QUIC 10k passes 15/15 with
  fd 14/16, sockets 5/6, sampled RSS 37,176/70,896 KiB, zero candidates, and three CID aliases.
  All 20,000 representative commits retain the original client/server worker PIDs, TUN, and one
  authenticated session without reconnect; the SHA remains exact after both gates.

  The tiered UDP adapter matrix on the same SHA is also complete: fake-TLS, obfs, and obfs+AWG each
  pass 1,000/1,000 commits and 15/15 checks. Their final client/server sampled RSS values are
  43,388/66,596, 45,316/68,412, and 35,844/78,288 KiB respectively; fd remain 14/16, sockets 5/6,
  candidates zero, and CID aliases three. The common `CORRECTED_WORKER_UDP_SHORT_ALL_PASS` marker is
  present, the background PID exits, and all test network namespaces are removed.
  A dedicated TCP performance gate now reuses the exact same netns runner and binary for an
  `off` baseline and a negotiated `required` sample. It takes configurable odd-count medians for
  upload, download, and combined qeli client/server CPU, and fails any relative regression beyond
  5% by default. Policy overrides are accepted only by the `perf` case, so success/soak cannot be
  accidentally downgraded. The live gate passed on a separate lab `.11` with fixed SHA-256
  `b8add83126dd1b6c608fa6288b7d227bf377ff3d27ce577db2dab5e114b265dc`: the `off` medians were
  518/648 Mbit/s upload/download and 160.255% combined CPU; `required` produced 528/648 Mbit/s and
  161.131% CPU. Both variants passed 10/10 functional checks without reconnect, and the final
  comparison passed 3/3 under the 5% budget. TCP 10k continued on separate `.10`, so the gates did
  not share CPU, namespaces, or processes.
  A single `roaming_resource_release_gate.sh` now pins the fail-closed resource acceptance order to
  one immutable binary: TCP/UDP all-mode smoke, TCP resume/grace, TCP 10k, representative UDP QUIC
  10k, UDP fake-TLS/obfs/obfs+AWG at 1k each, performance, and negative multi-node fallback.
  SHA-256 is checked before and after every phase, and a phase PASS
  marker is emitted only after a zero exit code. Any failure or binary replacement prevents every
  later phase from starting; contract tests pin the order, hash check, and absence of a false final
  PASS.
  The short phases were rerun fail-closed on one fixed binary with SHA-256
  `b8add83126dd1b6c608fa6288b7d227bf377ff3d27ce577db2dab5e114b265dc`: TCP smoke passed all six
  modes (`reality-tls` 21/21, the other five 17/17), UDP smoke passed all four modes at 19/19,
  hard-resume and grace-expiry passed 18/18 each, and multi-node fallback passed 26/26. The SHA
  matched after every phase; no test process or network namespace remained after the final gate.
  A negative TCP multi-node case now maps path A to the original process and path B to an
  independent process that shares identity/users but not the in-memory session registry. A
  foreign authenticated JOIN must fail with an unknown locator and must never commit; after path A
  is physically removed, `auto` must use the ordinary reconnect path, perform a second full AUTH,
  replace the assigned tunnel address, and restore traffic through path B. The immutable-binary lab
  gate passed 26/26: bidirectional TCP RST deterministically exposed carrier loss to both client and
  original server; after the 30-second resume budget the same supervisor completed a full AUTH on
  the second process, replaced `10.88.0.2/32` with `10.89.0.2/32`, installed the path-B bypass, and
  restored traffic without a foreign roaming commit.

## 8. Compatibility / rollout
Each roaming feature is negotiated through the existing authenticated capability trailer.
A feature-enabled server advertises only implemented server bits, and a session enters the TCP
roaming lifecycle only after the authenticated client extension opts in. Legacy peers keep the
normal full-reconnect path, so rollout does not require a lockstep server/client upgrade.
A source regression now pins this for both TCP and UDP against both an absent capability trailer
and a pre-`AUTH_EXT_V1` peer: `auto` keeps legacy AUTH, while `required` fails before credentials/
full AUTH. The live netns matrix additionally validates the actual 0.8.0 and 0.7.14 binaries in both
server/client directions for TCP and UDP. All compatible pairs establish a TUN, carry traffic, and
perform exactly one full AUTH without negotiating roaming; `required` against the legacy server
remains fail-closed before the TUN and full AUTH even while the headless CLI retries.
The initial server default is off and client policy is auto. Any failed or unsupported
transaction rolls back candidate resources and falls back to a full reconnect.

## 9. Effort estimate (rough)

Full delivery across the server, shared core, five client applications, panel,
documentation, and lab is approximately **20–30 engineering weeks**.

| Component | Size | Risk |
|---|---|---|
| CONTROL_V2, capabilities, KDF/proofs | Medium | High (protocol/security) |
| Server UDP registry/actor + PMTU/DATA_FRAG | Large | High (data plane) |
| Server TCP lifecycle + authenticated handover | Medium-large | High (races) |
| Shared-core supervisor and path transaction | Large | High |
| Five platform adapters, apps, panel, and config | Large | Medium-high |
| Lab matrix, soak, rollback, and rollout | Large | High |

Primary risks are cross-worker UDP state, TCP orphan/JOIN/reaper races, nonce reuse,
platform binding rollback, outer-family PMTU changes, iOS behavior, and interactions
