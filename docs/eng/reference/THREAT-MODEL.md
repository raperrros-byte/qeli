# qeli — Threat Model
<!-- normative-sync: threat-ipv6-v1 -->

This document states **what qeli defends against, what it deliberately does
not, and the current assurance status.** It is written so a user can decide
whether qeli fits their risk, and so a reviewer knows where to look. It
describes design intent; it is not a guarantee.

Русская версия: [`../ru/THREAT-MODEL.md`](../../ru/reference/THREAT-MODEL.md).

## 1. What qeli is for

qeli is a censorship-circumvention VPN. Its primary job is to carry a user's
traffic to a server **without a network adversary being able to (a) read it,
(b) tamper with it undetected, or (c) positively identify the flow as a VPN/qeli
flow and block it.** Privacy from the *server operator* is explicitly a non-goal
(you trust your own server, as with any VPN).

## 2. Adversaries we design against

| Adversary | Capability | qeli's answer |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| **On-path passive DPI** (GFW / TSPU style) | Reads every byte, classifies by signature/entropy/fingerprint | `reality-tls` uses REALITY TLS 1.3 + genuine H2 with randomized batching; `obfs` rides WebSocket fronting; nonce PRP protects the private record counter. Browser/H2 semantic parity remains incomplete and is not claimed. |
| **On-path active prober** | Replays/initiates connections to the server to test if it is a proxy | REALITY: a connection without a valid crypto token in the ClientHello `session_id` is transparently bridged to the real decoy site. Replayed ClientHellos are detected and also bridged. This reduces the obvious active-probe oracle; it does not prove universal equivalence to the target under timing or correlation analysis. |
| **On-path active MITM** | Intercepts and rewrites handshake records | Server-identity proof bound to the handshake transcript (channel binding): any swap of ServerHello/Certificate/Finished breaks the proof. Optional `bind_static_to_session` (on by default) binds session keys to the server's long-lived identity (Noise-IK style). |
| **Store-now-decrypt-later / future quantum** | Records traffic today, breaks X25519 with a future quantum computer | All non-`plain` modes run a hybrid X25519 + ML-KEM-768 key exchange; the data keys depend on **both** secrets. The server refuses a non-PQ handshake (no silent downgrade). |
| **Online credential guesser** | Tries to brute-force a user password or the panel admin | Argon2id password hashing; per-IP lockout + per-username adaptive tarpit on the tunnel; the same on the web panel API; constant-time proof comparison; dummy-hash work on unknown users to avoid username enumeration by timing. |
| **Replay attacker** | Re-sends captured ciphertext | 2048-bit sliding replay window per session; AEAD with unique per-packet nonces. |
| **Local unprivileged user on the client** | Tries to read secrets or hijack qeli's privileged file writes | Secrets/config/keys written atomically with `O_EXCL` + `O_NOFOLLOW` and preserved `0600` mode; control socket gated by a `0700` directory. |

The 2026-08-26 PCAP regression showed 0/6 detections by the old qeli-shape classifier, not a
universal probability. Residual passive signals include coherent browser TLS profile validity,
H2 SETTINGS/priority/window behavior, one long-lived POST and workload timing. See
[DPI-AUDIT.md](../reports/DPI-AUDIT.md).

## 3. Non-goals and residual leaks (READ THIS)

qeli does **not** claim to defend against the following. Some are fundamental;
some are explicit engineering trade-offs.

1. **Global passive traffic-correlation.** An adversary who can observe both
   ends of the path can correlate a flow by **packet timing and volume**.
   Padding and traffic normalization raise the cost but do not defeat a true
   global passive adversary. qeli is not a high-latency mix network.

2. **DNS metadata while the kill-switch is engaged.** The Linux kill-switch
   allows UDP/TCP port 53 so a *hostname* server can be re-resolved during a
   reconnect. While the tunnel is down, DNS queries (metadata only — not your
   data plane) can transit the physical link. Use an **IP** server address to
   close even this. The data plane and your real IP to arbitrary sites stay
   blocked. (See `qeli/src/client/killswitch.rs`.)

3. **Kill-switch coverage.** Each desktop platform ships a native, fail-safe
   kill-switch: Linux **iptables** (Rust core, `qeli/src/client/killswitch.rs`),
   Windows **WFP** (`New-NetFirewallRule` + default-block outbound,
   `qeli-win/QeliWin/Vpn/KillSwitch.cs`), macOS **pf** (`qeli-mac/QeliMac/Vpn/KillSwitch.cs`).
   All allow only the tun device, the server IP(s), DNS, and DHCP, and stay
   engaged across a crash (the host stays locked — no leak — until qeli runs
   again). The residual DNS-metadata trade-off (point 2) applies to all of them.
   On **Android**, use the OS-level *Always-on VPN + Block connections without VPN*.

4. **Endpoint compromise.** Malware, a hostile OS, a compromised client device,
   or a coerced/backdoored server are out of scope. qeli protects bytes on the
   wire, not a compromised endpoint.

5. **Server-operator trust.** Your server sees your decrypted traffic's
   destination (it is the exit). Run your own.

6. **The `plain` wire mode is not anti-DPI.** It is a bare encrypted tunnel
   (high-entropy from byte 0) intended for already-trusted networks or
   benchmarking — it is a red flag to an entropy detector. Use `obfs` /
   `reality-tls` against active censorship.

7. **Anonymity.** qeli is not Tor. It encrypts content and aims to obscure the VPN
   fingerprint from the DPI models described above; it does not guarantee that a censor
   cannot classify the flow, and it does not anonymize you from a determined global
   observer or from your server.

8. **Optional update check — OFF by default, disclosed here so it is never
   "covert".** qeli ships **no telemetry**. Its only built-in request to the qeli project
   or a developer-controlled service is the *opt-in* "check for updates" feature (Settings on the clients,
   `[web] update_check` on the panel, or `qeli version --check`). When you enable it,
   the client makes a **single unauthenticated GET** of public GitHub release metadata
   (`/repos/litvinovtd/qeli/releases`) — with a **generic User-Agent**, sending nothing
   that identifies you or your device; the version comparison is done locally. On the GUI
   clients it only fires **while the tunnel is up**, and it follows the OS route table.
   **Careful: "the tunnel is up" is not the same as "the request went through it."** In
   full-tunnel it does, and GitHub sees your server's IP. In **split-tunnel** — the default
   on the CLI and the desktop clients — or if GitHub falls under an `exclude`, the request
   goes out directly and GitHub sees your real IP. If you need the guarantee, enable the
   update check only on a full-tunnel profile. The CLI's `qeli version --check` has no
   tunnel gate at all: it performs the request whenever you run it. The panel check runs in
   the operator's browser, not the server process. It is **notification-only** — it never
   downloads or installs anything. Left OFF (the default), qeli opens no update-check socket.
   The residual, when enabled, is a "this host asked GitHub for the qeli repo" signal
   to whatever sees the request (inside the tunnel, that is your own exit's upstream).

9. **Profile reachability polling — OFF by default (opt-in).** Windows, macOS and
   Android periodically contact every configured VPN endpoint only after this feature is
   explicitly enabled, to paint the status dot and latency. Once enabled, the default
   interval is 30 seconds (configurable from 10 to 3600 seconds); automatic sweeps stop
   while a tunnel is connecting/connected, and Android additionally limits them to a
   visible app. TCP profiles get a bounded TCP connect; UDP profiles get a credential-free
   protocol first flight. These diagnostics send no data to the qeli project, but the
   configured servers and an on-path observer can see their timing. With auto-polling off,
   network probes run only when the user explicitly requests a manual check.


10. **Configured server-side egress.** A `reality-tls` handrolled profile probes its configured
    target at startup and every 12 hours to refresh the borrowed certificate/shape. DNS
    forwarding and optional notification/webhook destinations also make the network requests
    their configuration explicitly requests. None of these is telemetry, but an operator's
    egress policy must allow and account for them.

### 3.1. Roaming linkability and path changes

Roaming preserves one authenticated VPN session when the physical network changes.
It improves continuity; it does not make the old and new paths unlinkable.

- **UDP on the wire.** Each committed path gets a new directional eight-byte CID. This
  removes a stable cleartext qeli locator across the handover, but not timing or volume signals.
- **TCP on the wire.** The JOIN/resume proof and stable session locator travel only inside the
  newly encrypted carrier; no reusable resume token is exposed as cleartext.
- **Who can correlate.** The server necessarily attaches both peer addresses to the same
  authenticated session to retain its TUN address and NetworkPlan. An observer that sees both
  networks can still correlate the transition by timing, volume, or make-before-break overlap.
  CID rotation removes the trivial identifier; it is not an anonymity guarantee.

### 3.2. Residual dual-stack, TAP, and fragmentation risks

- **Outer/inner family confusion.** IPv6 reachability to the server does not imply inner
  IPv6, and vice versa. Capability or NetworkPlan drift can cause a silent downgrade;
  `required` plus generation ACK must turn that into failure. `allow_*_leak` explicitly
  accepts direct-family egress.
- **TAP control plane.** qeli is not an L2 bridge, but local ARP/NDP/RA handling still parses
  untrusted input. Unknown EtherTypes, malformed NDP/RA, VLAN, and oversized frames must be
  dropped; TAP needs its own matrix in addition to ordinary TUN testing.
- **DATA_FRAG DoS.** An authenticated peer can create many incomplete reassemblies. Bounded
  bytes/fragments/entries/expiry limit damage but do not remove CPU/memory as a DoS surface;
  fuzzing, quota/drop metrics, and soak tests remain required.
- **PMTU/ICMPv6.** Lost Packet Too Big messages or filtered ICMPv6 create black holes; forged
  PTB can reduce throughput. Probe and PMTU state must bind to path, family, and source.
- **NAT66 and routed GUA.** NAT66 hides addresses but is not a firewall; routed GUA makes
  client addresses globally routable and requires explicit upstream routing and ACL policy.
- **Persistent TUN.** Interface reuse is safe only when the full NetworkPlan fingerprint
  matches: families, addresses, routes, DNS, MTU, and leak policy.

## 4. Assurance status

- **Independent external audit: NOT yet done.** The largest single attack
  surface is the **hand-rolled TLS 1.3 stack** (`qeli/src/protocol/realtls/*`,
  ~3k lines), written so the wire fingerprint can be controlled byte-for-byte
  and to cross-compile without `ring`. It has had internal review and is
  covered by unit tests, but no third-party cryptographic audit. Treat it
  accordingly.
- **Fuzzing:** harnesses for the untrusted-input parsers (ClientHello, packet codec, realtls
  records, and roaming wire contracts) live under [`qeli/fuzz/`](../../../qeli/fuzz). Continuous
  fuzzing coverage is being built out.
- **Tests:** the crate has an extensive in-tree unit-test suite (crypto vectors,
  replay window, handshake transcript binding, config round-trips) enforced as a
  CI merge gate alongside `clippy -D warnings` and `rustfmt`.
- **Reproducibility:** prebuilt native cores are currently committed to the repo
  for client convenience; migrating to published, checksummed, reproducible
  build artifacts is tracked in [`ROADMAP.md`](../plans/ROADMAP.md).
- **Memory hygiene (accepted limitation):** long-lived secrets are zeroized on
  drop (X25519 static/ephemeral keys, the HKDF input keying material). The
  *transient* per-session AEAD keys held inside the realtls TLS-record objects
  (`aes-gcm`'s expanded key schedule) are NOT zeroized — the upstream `aes-gcm`
  crate does not implement `Zeroize`, and the expanded round keys live inside its
  cipher object, out of qeli's reach. This is accepted defence-in-depth debt: an
  attacker who can read the process's freed heap can already read the *live* keys
  during a session, so it does not change the threat model. Revisit on a
  dedicated memory-hygiene pass or a cipher-crate change.

## 5. If your life depends on this

Then: pin the server identity key (`require_client_key_proof`), use an **IP**
(not hostname) server address with the kill-switch on, use `reality-tls`, keep
all components on the same released version, and understand points 1 and 4
above. And prefer tools that have completed an independent audit until qeli has.
