# Qeli documentation — map

The single navigation point. Documents are grouped **by audience**: what a user and an
operator need first, then internal and historical material.

> New here? Start with **[Getting started](GETTING-STARTED.md)**, then
> **[Configuration](CONFIG.md)**. If something doesn't work — **[Troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md)**.
