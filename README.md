**Qeli** (Quick Easy Link IP) — a self-hosted VPN with its own L4 protocol and built-in
obfuscation over TCP or UDP. It aims at resilience against passive / signature-based DPI
while keeping the convenience of a classic full-tunnel TUN VPN, and ships with a web admin
panel.

## What it is

- **A TUN VPN, with optional per-app routing**: routing and DNS are handled at the OS level.
  The default covers every application; Windows, macOS and Android can also include or exclude
  selected applications without replacing qeli with an application-layer SOCKS/HTTP proxy.
  Full-tunnel and split-tunnel are both first-class.
- **Wire modes**: `plain` · `fake-tls` (TLS 1.3 mimicry) · `obfs` (ChaCha20 stream +
  WebSocket fronting) · `reality` · `reality-tls` (REALITY TLS 1.3 + a genuine HTTP/2
  carrier) · QUIC-shaped compatibility masking for UDP (not real QUIC/HTTP3).
- **Post-quantum handshake**: hybrid X25519 + ML-KEM-768, ChaCha20-Poly1305 data plane.
- **Web admin panel** with `qeli://` link / QR issuance, Argon2id login, native HTTPS.
- **Server**: Linux (TUN/TAP). **Clients**: Linux CLI · Windows · macOS · Android ·
  Keenetic / OpenWrt routers — plus iOS, which is feature-complete but has never been run
  on a device and ships nothing yet ([details](qeli-ios/README.md)).

## Designed for active-DPI environments

Qeli is built for networks where ordinary VPN protocols (WireGuard, OpenVPN, IKEv2) are
fingerprinted and blocked — Iran, China (the Great Firewall) and Russia (TSPU). The
`reality-tls` carries the private qeli stream through one long-lived genuine HTTP/2 request
inside a real TLS 1.3 exchange shaped from a configured third-party target; connections without
a valid qeli token are bridged to that target. This removes the former inner fake-TLS
choreography and reduces known passive and active-probing tells, but does not make the flow
universally indistinguishable. The shipped Reality profiles disable the periodic qeli heartbeat
and enable bounded randomized idle cover; the schema baseline for non-stealth profiles remains
unchanged. Statistical DPI resistance is a measured property, not a guarantee.

> In spirit a self-hosted alternative to Xray / V2Ray / sing-box (REALITY/VLESS) setups, but
> with its own protocol, native GUI clients and a post-quantum handshake.

## Benchmarks

A repeatable two-VM lab run covered 34 VPN modes, with three passes for 25 masked modes.
Across all 12 Qeli profiles, average four-stream TCP throughput was **1220 Mbit/s**; the five
fast TCP profiles averaged **1767 Mbit/s**, while every Qeli profile ran with Recordizer in
required mode. These figures compare throughput and processing cost on one controlled lab,
not the probability of bypassing an external DPI system. See the
**[full Qeli 0.8.0 cross-protocol report in English](docs/eng/reports/benchmarks/vpn_protocol_benchmark_repeat_2026-09-01.md)**
or **[the Russian version](docs/ru/reports/benchmarks/vpn_protocol_benchmark_repeat_2026-09-01.md)**,
plus the maintained [English methodology/history](docs/eng/reports/BENCHMARK.md).

## Quick start

**One command on a clean Linux server (Debian/Ubuntu), as root:**

```bash
curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/litvinovtd/qeli/main/install-qeli-server.sh
```

Review it, then run `bash install-qeli-server.sh`. Download-then-run (rather than
`curl … | bash`) exists so the script can be read before it executes as root; the installer
itself verifies the `.deb` against its SHA256.

The script installs the `.deb` from [Releases](https://github.com/litvinovtd/qeli/releases),
asks for the profile and the listen port (default `443`), writes a config with full-tunnel
NAT, creates users and prints ready-to-use `qeli://` links. Three profiles are offered:

| Profile | When to pick it |
|---------|-----------------|
| `reality-tls` | Installer default. REALITY TLS 1.3 + genuine HTTP/2 on TCP:443; unauthenticated probes are bridged to the configured target. |
| `fake-tls` | Cheaper on CPU; enough against passive/signature DPI. |
| `udp-quic` | A UDP path with QUIC-shaped datagrams — useful where TCP:443 is throttled, reset or otherwise degraded. |

For a non-interactive run set the answers up front:
`QELI_PROFILE=reality-tls|fake-tls|udp-quic` and/or `QELI_PORT=<1-65535>`.

Then install a client from Releases and paste or scan the link.

2. Configure it — **[CONFIG (EN)](docs/eng/manuals/CONFIG.md)** · **[CONFIG (RU)](docs/ru/manuals/CONFIG.md)**.
3. Enable and verify dual-stack or IPv6-only operation — **[IPv6 guide (EN)](docs/eng/manuals/IPV6.md)** ·
   **[Руководство по IPv6 (RU)](docs/ru/manuals/IPV6.md)**.
4. Issue a `qeli://` link or QR from the web panel and import it into a client —

## Status

Current beta release: **qeli 0.8.1** — a consolidation of the 0.8 network architecture focused on
UDP throughput, continuity across network changes, deployable IPv6 and safer operational state.
See the [bilingual release notes](release/RELEASE_NOTES_0.8.1.md) for the outcome, upgrade steps and artifacts.

Pre-1.0 / beta — the data plane is stable and covered by unit + end-to-end tests, but the
protocol may still change between minor versions. Release builds are published on the
**GitHub Releases** page and are not committed to git. The client **native cores** are the
exception: `libqeli.so` / `qeli.dll` / `libqeli.dylib` (plus third-party `wintun.dll`) are
committed under `native-libs/` and mirrored into each client tree, so the platform CI jobs
need only their own toolchain. Their hashes are pinned in `native-libs/SHA256SUMS` and
checked by the `native-libs` CI gate. This is an explicit trade-off against reproducibility
— see [THREAT-MODEL §4](docs/eng/reference/THREAT-MODEL.md#4-assurance-status) ·
