"""Shared SSH / lab helpers for the qeli scripts.

Centralizes the paramiko connection boilerplate and the lab/prod host constants that
were copy-pasted across ~97 scripts in this folder (each defined its own ``connect`` /
``ssh`` / ``run`` and hardcoded the VM IPs). See docs/REFACTOR-PLAN.md (R7).

Passwords are read from the ``QELI_LAB_PASS`` env var — never hardcode credentials.

Usage:
    from lab_common import connect, run, LAB_SRV, LAB_CLI, PROD
    c = connect(LAB_SRV)
    print(run(c, "uptime"))
