"""Keep every version string in the repo in sync. Run from anywhere:

There are THREE versions in this repo and they are deliberately different:

  * the DEVELOPMENT version — what the tree currently builds. Source of truth:
    `qeli/Cargo.toml`. It is mirrored into the platform build files plus the two overview
    READMEs ("Rust 2021, version X").
  * the PLANNED version — the next public release. Source of truth: the first
    unreleased CHANGELOG heading. A development build may intentionally retain
    an older version number; for example the 0.7.17 development tree is released
    directly as 0.8.0, without a public 0.7.17 release.
  * the RELEASED version — the newest published package. Source of truth: the
    newest `v*` git tag. It is shown as the latest published release in the
    ten-document status banner and owns released download/attestation commands.

Bumping by hand means editing many files, which is how docs once ended up claiming
0.7.11 while the crate was already 0.7.12. Markdown on GitHub has no variable
substitution, so the only way to templatise this is to stamp at commit time —
which is what `--write` does.

Exit code 0 = everything agrees, 1 = something drifted (or was rewritten).
