## English

### Before upgrading

- There is no new configuration-format migration, but validation is stricter. Run
  `qeli check-config` on the final server configuration and every enabled client/profile before
  replacing a working installation.
- Fix invalid `allowed_networks`, out-of-range route metrics, unreachable REALITY targets,
  conflicting TUN names and Quick Start bind collisions. The previous code could accept or hide
  some of these states; `0.7.16` deliberately refuses them.
- The current inner data plane is IPv4-only. IPv6 DNS resolvers and an IPv6-literal `PUBLIC_HOST`
  are now rejected explicitly instead of generating a client profile that cannot work.
- Validate a backup before relying on it. Restore now requires the active server config and its
  referenced users database, rejects unsafe hooks/symlinks/type changes, and will not call a
  restore exact while leaving extra nested live files behind.
- Logging out of the panel revokes every currently issued panel session. Other browsers and panel
  processes will have to authenticate again.
- Rolling upgrades from the historical qeli QUIC-masking spelling remain accepted. New peers emit
  the strict Initial form; malformed, truncated or tailed records that older builds tolerated are
  now rejected.

### Connection recovery and mobile roaming

- A reconnect intentionally requested after sleep or a physical network change no longer counts
  as a failed connection. The exponential delay therefore stays clear instead of growing to 32
  seconds merely because a user wakes the phone repeatedly.
- Android compares the physical-network signature before cycling a healthy tunnel. During a real
  handover it can select a validated carrier even while the system temporarily reports the VPN
  itself as active, and it advances the baseline only after reconnecting to that carrier.
- A late platform acknowledgement from an already retired generation is normal. One stale event
  or handler exception no longer kills the Android/iOS dispatcher and poisons every subsequent
  connection until the service is restarted.
- Physical DNS recovery on Android uses a bounded two-worker, per-network pool. One resolver stuck
  on an old network cannot block the replacement carrier, while repeated network flaps cannot
  create an unbounded thread or request queue.
- Terminal background failures remain observable even when the event queue is full. A late ACK
  cannot revive a failed generation, and an unusable one-slot event queue is rejected up front.
- Android and iOS now bound profile/config imports, validate a complete prospective archive before
  persistence, and keep expensive file/KDF work off the UI thread. iOS normalises duplicate UUIDs;
  both mobile clients cap reachability fan-out at four concurrent probes.

### Packet path, MTU and loss diagnostics

- Downlink pools are sized from the negotiated MTU plus protocol headroom instead of reserving the
  64 KiB protocol maximum for every ordinary packet. Android, iOS and the Windows packet path now
  retain enough slots to absorb a TUN-writer stall without manufacturing an `internal_drops`
  storm. A genuinely larger record can still grow its individual buffer.
- Internal drops are split into pool exhaustion, queue full, oversize, unsupported packet and TUN
  write failures. Previously invisible `EAGAIN`/`ENOBUFS` failures now reach Linux CLI diagnostics.
- A failed TUN queue duplication or partial packet write is fatal to that writer and is surfaced;
  a truncated IP packet is no longer reported as successfully delivered.
- Windows per-app NAT adjusts TCP/UDP checksums of already-fragmented IPv4 datagrams incrementally
  across address/port rewrites. It no longer calculates a false checksum over only the first
  fragment; malformed partial transport headers are dropped fail-closed.

### Fail-closed host lifecycle

- Linux DNS ownership is recorded per interface before changing systemd-resolved. Failed reverts
  remain retryable, stale recovery leaves live foreign interfaces alone, and legacy
  `/etc/resolv.conf` state is restored only after its last verified owner exits.
- Gateway NAT and exit-node setup fails if IPv4 forwarding cannot be enabled. Partial sysctl and
  firewall work is rolled back, cleanup errors remain visible, and incompatible gateway/exit-node
  combinations are rejected before traffic starts.
- The Linux kill switch uses instance-specific chains, rolls back partial installation, refreshes
  server-IP allowances without opening egress, and is removed only after routes, NAT and forwarding
  have been cleaned. Failed inspection is no longer confused with an absent rule.
- Route ownership survives a failed deletion so cleanup can be retried. Qeli refuses to delete or
  attach an existing TUN whose ownership cannot be proven, and preflight detects shared TUN names
  even when one conflicting profile is disabled.
- Concurrent first starts converge on one durable device ID, identity key, TOFU pin and panel
  session key. Corrupt or locked state is preserved and reported instead of being silently replaced
  by fresh trust material.
- `auth.password_command` must exit successfully, and the effective credential length is checked
  for password-file and command sources as well as inline passwords. Passwords and obfuscation keys
  are zeroized when every cloned reconnect/bonding configuration owner is dropped.

### Windows and macOS

- The macOS GUI can again install and stop its launchd daemon through the system administrator
  prompt. The elevated helper clears the signal mask leaked by `security_authtrampoline`, so a
  completed `launchctl`, `networksetup`, `route`, `ifconfig` or `pfctl` child is no longer reported
  as a 20/30-second timeout. The full reset is restricted to a macOS root helper launched by the
  GUI with `QELI_INVOKING_UID` and one of the four daemon-management verbs; the normal GUI,
  launchd service and direct CLI retain their parent signal policy.
- A desktop tunnel generation cannot start while its predecessor may still own TUN, socket, route
  or firewall state. Start, DNS, network-plan, kill-switch and teardown errors reach the service and
  UI instead of being flattened into a false `Disconnected` state.
- Windows and macOS keep the active-profile identity until a replacement generation has actually
  started. A live reconnect loop remains stoppable in the Error state, and an active profile is not
  edited or deleted when its teardown could not be proven complete.
- Desktop `persist_tun` now reuses Wintun/utun only when a canonical fingerprint of the applied
  address/prefix, effective MTU and ordered DNS, routes (including `route_file`), exclusions and
  carrier path is unchanged. A changed authenticated plan is rebuilt before its positive ACK.
- The platform boundary rejects an empty or wrong-generation `NetworkPlan`, an unsupported DNS
  endpoint, and a native ownership mode without the corresponding TUN/Wintun/packet descriptor.
- Windows/macOS per-app routing now honours `gateway = false`: selected applications tunnel only
  explicit/pushed routes and the connected tunnel subnet, while other public IPv4 and native IPv6
  stay direct. Explicit IPv6 includes remain captured fail-closed.
- The macOS kill switch is isolated in a PF anchor instead of replacing the global ruleset. It
  distinguishes a live owner from crash residue, serialises PF operations, rolls back partial
  engage, and permits port 53 only to the system's configured resolvers rather than to any host.
- Elevated Windows native extraction uses a non-inheriting directory writable only by
  Administrators and SYSTEM. Both privileged services refuse a new tunnel when stale kill-switch
  recovery has not been proven successful.
- The desktop editor keeps supported INI fields that are not represented by a form control. It
  preserves unresolved invalid/unknown-key evidence, clears only the marker for a field the user
  actually fixed, and refuses a malformed supplied pinned key instead of silently enabling TOFU.

### Server, panel, users and backup

- A profile generation closes task admission and joins every child before removing TUN/NAT state.
  An old supervisor cannot unregister a replacement generation with the same name. The control
  socket is bound before the data plane and a lost control task is a worker failure, not a hidden
  detached condition.
- Client subprocess shutdown has a bounded wait, kill and reap path. Process handles are retained
  when teardown fails so a later cleanup attempt does not lose the only way to reap the child.
- Usage accounting fails closed on a corrupt file. Reload keeps the last good diagnostic snapshot;
  reset and periodic flush are serialised, and failed persistence restores the in-memory counters.
- Authenticated panel logout persists and atomically advances the global session generation. A
  durability failure is reported instead of claiming success. Concurrent key creation converges
  under a sidecar lock, private files are mode `0600`, and unreadable revocation state never falls
  back to generation zero.
- User/group destination ACLs are validated in the configuration layer for panel, inline, file and
  restored inputs. An explicitly configured but malformed ACL cannot become unrestricted. Route
  metrics must be integral `u32`, and user mutations validate a complete clone before publication.
- Preflight recognises typed Linux routes such as `blackhole`, `unreachable` and `prohibit` and does
  not let a disabled qeli profile hide a collision with a physical interface or route.
- Backup/restore validates the complete staged configuration and dependency graph before publish.
  The active path must stay below `/etc/qeli`; referenced users files must be present and valid;
  unknown `.conf` content, unsafe hooks, symlinks, staged/live type mismatches and inexact nested
  state are rejected.
- Quick Start checks the existing profile's effective saved port and transport, not the current UI
  card defaults. Relaunching the same mode is allowed; a real collision with another profile is not.
- IPv6 DNS resolvers are rejected in both client configuration and server push, and the installer
  refuses an IPv6-literal `PUBLIC_HOST` while the inner data plane remains IPv4-only.
- The client round-trip fixture now pins `server`, `dns_servers` and every runtime key, preventing a
  parser option from being added without coverage for its persisted representation.
- `install-polkit` and `set-service-user` validate service-unit and account names before using them
  in paths or generated policy, write rules/drop-ins atomically with explicit permissions, and
  check `chmod`, `chown` and `systemctl daemon-reload` results. Returning from root to the qeli
  account repairs `/etc/qeli` ownership before removing the last working root override.
- The panel shows the current server hostname beside its version, and its UDP badges now distinguish
  queue capacity from socket-buffer occupancy. Administrative access is detected with a real
  `pkcheck` request instead of trying to read system polkit rules that are normally inaccessible to
  the unprivileged service account; missing helpers and indeterminate results are not presented as
  a confirmed denial.
- Panel profile deletion must first stop the client and remove its primary file; auxiliary
  log/status cleanup failures are returned as warnings. Notification serialization and web TLS
  directory-creation errors can no longer produce an empty/partial file or a falsely successful
  startup.

### Framing, encapsulation and wire compatibility

- The native FFI rejects a null pointer with a positive length. A stream ending halfway through a
  TLS record produces `UnexpectedEof`, never a clean end-of-stream.
- Rust, retained C# and Swift decoders require an AEAD record to consume the supplied packet
  exactly. A valid authenticated prefix followed by unauthenticated bytes is rejected, and an
  in-place destination is cleared on every decode failure.
- UDP handshake records are length- and overflow-checked before PQ/TLS key-schedule work. Truncated
  ChangeCipherSpec, Certificate, Finished or NewSessionTicket data cannot advance an offset beyond
  the datagram.
- TCP/sans-IO handshakes also require the expected ChangeCipherSpec and NewSessionTicket instead of
  swallowing read failures. Certificate generation, TLS 1.3 configuration and ticket-provider
  failures return from REALITY setup instead of panicking; IPv6 decoy endpoints use the common
  host/port formatter.
- New QUIC-masking packets emit the exact qeli Initial form (`0xC3`). Parsing validates version 1,
  the four-byte DCID, empty SCID and token, declared Length, four-byte packet number, exact short
  flags and complete datagram consumption. Only the exact historical `0xE3` form is accepted for a
  rolling upgrade; arbitrary packet types, huge/truncated varints and trailing bytes are rejected.
- Server mode selection uses the same full structural parser instead of a prefix test. Rust, C# and
  Swift consume common generated fixtures for packet decode, QUIC, fragmentation, replay windows,
  PRP nonces and HKDF domains.
- Documentation now states the actual boundary: this is QUIC-shaped masking, not a full QUIC
  implementation. Initial AEAD, QUIC header protection, CRYPTO frames and 1200-byte Initial padding
  are not implemented.

### Build and release hygiene

- The deliberate-cycle symbol is available on every target, fixing the Android core E0425 hidden
  by stale prebuilt libraries. The final Windows x64, macOS universal2 and Android arm64-v8a/x86_64
  cores were rebuilt in independent A/B passes with byte-identical results and refreshed provenance.
- The hardening changes again pass Rust formatting and lint compilation. A raw-descriptor teardown
  test waits for real destruction and is serialised so another test cannot reuse the same fd number
  and create a false failure.
- Keenetic helpers resolve files from their own checkout instead of a developer-specific absolute
  path, native recipe tests cover that rule, and helper failures retain a non-zero exit status.
- Four obsolete one-host deploy/link scripts that overwrote live configuration or used a fixed
  example credential are retired before any SSH import or connection attempt.
- The server installer selects the release `.deb` for the host's Debian architecture, verifies the
  package metadata for downloaded and explicitly supplied packages, and registers its temporary
  package/checksum files with the exit cleanup trap.
- Temporary round-trip snippets were removed from `release/` so they cannot be mistaken for final
  release inputs. Version `0.7.16` and platform build numbers are synchronised across the source
  tree.
- Version checking now includes the signed macOS per-app extension, and IPv4/DNS diagnostics take
  their version from `CARGO_PKG_VERSION` rather than a hard-coded previous release.
- The dependency baseline now uses the complete Avalonia `11.3.20` macOS set, .NET Windows service
  packages `10.0.11`, stable AppCompat `1.8.0`, Gradle `9.7.0`, signed wrapper-validation action
  `v6.3.0`, and patch-level Rust lockfile updates for rcgen, serde_json, socket2, clap and
  thiserror. Because `Cargo.lock` is part of the native source digest, the native cores were rebuilt
  from clean commit `b1e220d` in independent A/B passes on labs `.10`/`.11`; canonical and consumed
  copies, hashes, evidence and provenance agree on source digest
  `85d7163bd1f2632077070cd3706ceb49993cc13b21671353ab225161aef4e7e7`.
- The Android release sync now transfers the pinned wrapper JAR and both launcher scripts as build
  inputs, not just `gradle-wrapper.properties`. After the Gradle `9.7.0` cache was populated once,
  the signed `719` / `0.7.16` APK passed a clean unit-test, lint, R8 and assembly run fully offline.
- The `fmt_clippy.py push` lab helper now creates missing remote directories and synchronises the
  complete Git-tracked Rust build-input set, including `Cargo.lock`, web templates/fonts, config,
  conformance data and `deny.toml`; Clippy/tests no longer depend on an incomplete or stale lab tree.
- The transitive `h2` dependency is updated from `0.4.15` to `0.4.16`, fixing
  `RUSTSEC-2026-0258` (an unbounded stream of empty HTTP/2 DATA frames); the final dependency graph
  passes `cargo audit` with no vulnerabilities.
- `qeli-linux-amd64` and `qeli_0.7.16_amd64.deb` were rebuilt from source baseline `b1e220d`; the
  complete lab gate passed, including 635 library tests plus 8 CLI/config tests, formatting, Clippy,
  fuzz/conformance checks, cargo-deny and the portable glibc 2.28 ABI check.

## Русский

### Перед обновлением

- Нового перехода формата конфигурации нет, но проверки стали строже. Перед заменой работающей
  установки выполните `qeli check-config` для финального серверного конфига и всех включённых
  клиентов/профилей.
- Исправьте невалидные `allowed_networks`, выходящие за `u32` метрики маршрутов, недостижимые
  REALITY targets, совпадающие TUN names и коллизии bind в Quick Start. `0.7.16` намеренно
  отказывается запускать состояния, которые прежний код мог принять или скрыть.
- Текущий внутренний data plane поддерживает только IPv4. IPv6 DNS resolver и IPv6 literal в
  `PUBLIC_HOST` теперь явно отклоняются вместо генерации неработоспособного профиля клиента.
- Проверьте backup до того, как считать его аварийной копией. Restore требует active server config
  и указанную им базу пользователей, отклоняет небезопасные hooks, symlink и смену типа объекта,
  а exact restore больше не оставляет молча лишние вложенные live-файлы.
- Logout панели отзывает все выданные panel sessions. На других устройствах и в других процессах
  панели потребуется войти повторно.
- Rolling upgrade со старой qeli-формой QUIC masking поддерживается. Новые peers отправляют строгий
  Initial; malformed, truncated и содержащие хвост records, которые ранее могли пройти, теперь
  отклоняются.

### Восстановление соединения и roaming

- Намеренный reconnect после сна или смены физической сети больше не считается сетевой ошибкой и
  не разгоняет backoff до 32 секунд при каждом пробуждении телефона.
- Android сравнивает сигнатуру физического пути и не перезапускает здоровый tunnel на обычном
  screen-off. При реальном handover он находит валидированную carrier-сеть, даже когда система
  временно считает активным собственный VPN, и обновляет baseline только после reconnect.
- Поздний platform ACK от уже завершённой generation является ожидаемым исходом гонки. Один stale
  event или exception больше не убивает Android/iOS dispatcher до перезапуска сервиса.
- Физический DNS Android работает через ограниченный пул из двух workers на разные сети: зависший
  resolver старой сети не блокирует новую, а network flap не создаёт бесконечную очередь потоков.
- Терминальная runtime-ошибка остаётся видимой при заполненной очереди событий; поздний ACK не
  оживляет упавшую generation, а заведомо непригодная однослотовая очередь отклоняется заранее.
- Android и iOS ограничивают импорт профилей/backup, проверяют полный prospective-архив до записи
  и не выполняют файловый ввод/KDF на UI thread. iOS нормализует повторные UUID; оба мобильных
  клиента ограничивают reachability четырьмя одновременными probe.

### Packet path, MTU и диагностика потерь

- Downlink-пулы рассчитываются по согласованному MTU с протокольным запасом, а не по максимуму
  64 КиБ на каждый обычный пакет. Android, iOS и Windows packet path сохраняют достаточно слотов
  при кратком stall TUN writer, а реально большой record при необходимости расширяет свой buffer.
- `internal_drops` разделён на pool exhaustion, queue full, oversize, unsupported packet и TUN
  write. Ранее невидимые `EAGAIN`/`ENOBUFS` публикуются в Linux CLI diagnostics.
- Ошибка дублирования очереди TUN и частичная запись пакета больше не считаются успехом и
  останавливают writer с диагностируемой причиной.
- Windows per-app NAT корректирует TCP/UDP checksum уже фрагментированных IPv4-датаграмм
  инкрементально при замене адресов/портов. Checksum больше не считается по одному первому
  фрагменту; неполный transport header отклоняется fail-closed.

### Fail-closed lifecycle хоста

- Linux DNS записывает per-interface ownership до изменения systemd-resolved, сохраняет маркер при
  неудачном revert, не трогает живой чужой интерфейс и восстанавливает legacy `resolv.conf` только
  после выхода последнего подтверждённого владельца.
- Gateway NAT и exit node не стартуют без реально включённого IPv4 forwarding; частичные sysctl и
  firewall изменения откатываются, ошибки cleanup не скрываются, несовместимая комбинация
  gateway/exit-node отклоняется.
- Linux kill switch использует цепочки отдельного экземпляра, откатывает частичный engage,
  безопасно обновляет server-IP allows и снимается только после маршрутов, NAT и forwarding.
- Неудачно удалённый маршрут остаётся в журнале владения для повтора. Qeli не удаляет и не
  присоединяет существующий TUN без доказанного владельца и заранее находит совпадающие TUN names.
- Конкурентный первый запуск сходится к одному device ID, identity key, TOFU pin и session key.
  Повреждённое или заблокированное состояние сохраняется и выдаёт ошибку, а не заменяется молча.
- `auth.password_command` обязан завершиться успешно; длина фактического credential проверяется и
  для password-file/command, а не только для inline password. Password и obfuscation key обнуляются
  после Drop каждого клона конфигурации, использовавшегося reconnect/bonding.

### Windows и macOS

- macOS GUI снова устанавливает и останавливает launchd-демон через системный диалог
  администратора. Elevated helper очищает маску сигналов, унаследованную от
  `security_authtrampoline`, поэтому завершившиеся `launchctl`, `networksetup`, `route`, `ifconfig`
  и `pfctl` больше не считаются 20/30-секундными timeout. Полный сброс выполняется только macOS
  root-helper, запущенным GUI с `QELI_INVOKING_UID` и одной из четырёх daemon-команд; обычные GUI,
  launchd service и прямой CLI сохраняют signal policy родителя.
- Новая desktop generation не стартует, пока предыдущая может владеть TUN/socket/routes/firewall.
  Ошибки start, DNS, NetworkPlan, kill switch и teardown доходят до службы и UI вместо ложного
  `Disconnected`.
- Windows и macOS сохраняют identity активного профиля до фактического запуска replacement,
  позволяют остановить живой reconnect-loop из статуса Error и не редактируют/не удаляют активный
  профиль, если его teardown не удалось доказанно завершить.
- Desktop `persist_tun` повторно использует Wintun/utun только при совпадении fingerprint
  применённых IP/prefix, MTU, упорядоченного DNS, маршрутов вместе с `route_file`, исключений и
  carrier path. Изменившийся authenticated plan пересобирается до положительного ACK.
- Проверяется непустой plan, его generation, поддерживаемость DNS endpoint и наличие descriptor,
  соответствующего заявленному native TUN/Wintun/packet ownership.
- Windows/macOS per-app теперь соблюдает `gateway = false`: выбранные приложения направляют в VPN
  только явные/pushed routes и связанную туннельную подсеть, а остальные public IPv4 и native IPv6
  идут напрямую. Явные IPv6 include остаются захваченными fail-closed.
- macOS kill switch живёт в отдельном PF anchor, различает активного владельца и crash residue,
  сериализует операции и разрешает port 53 только к системным resolver вместо `to any`.
- Elevated Windows extraction использует каталог без наследования с записью только для
  Administrators/SYSTEM. Привилегированный service не запускает tunnel при недоказанном recovery.
- Desktop editor сохраняет не показанные формой INI-поля и не «отмывает» неизвестные/ошибочные
  ключи. Исправленное поле освобождается от marker, а malformed pinned key не включает TOFU молча.

### Сервер, панель, пользователи и backup

- Profile generation запрещает новые задачи и join-ит дочерние до удаления TUN/NAT. Старый
  supervisor не удаляет replacement с тем же именем. Control socket связывается до data plane, а
  исчезновение control task завершает worker с ошибкой.
- Client subprocess получает timeout, kill и обязательный reap; handle не теряется при ошибке
  teardown и остаётся доступным для следующей попытки cleanup.
- Usage accounting не заменяет повреждённый файл пустыми квотами. Reload хранит последний хороший
  snapshot, reset и flush сериализованы, а неудачная запись откатывает in-memory counters.
- Аутентифицированный logout сохраняет и атомарно повышает общую session generation; ошибка
  долговременной записи возвращается вместо ложного успеха. Конкурентное создание key сходится под
  sidecar lock, приватные файлы имеют `0600`, нечитаемый revoke-state не превращается в разрешающую
  generation `0`.
- Destination ACL пользователей/групп проверяется одинаково для panel, inline, file и restore.
  Полностью ошибочный настроенный список не становится unrestricted; metric обязан быть `u32`, а
  mutation валидирует полный clone до публикации.
- Preflight понимает typed routes (`blackhole`, `unreachable`, `prohibit`) и не позволяет
  отключённому qeli-профилю скрыть конфликт с физическим интерфейсом или route.
- Backup/restore валидирует staged config и зависимости до publish: active path остаётся в
  `/etc/qeli`, users file присутствует и корректен, неизвестный `.conf`, hooks, symlink, type
  mismatch и неточный nested restore отклоняются.
- Quick Start проверяет сохранённые effective port/transport существующего профиля, а не defaults
  карточки. Повтор своего режима разрешён, настоящий конфликт с другим профилем — нет.
- IPv6 DNS resolver отклоняется и в client config, и в server push; installer не принимает IPv6
  literal `PUBLIC_HOST`, пока внутренний data plane остаётся IPv4-only.
- Round-trip fixture клиента фиксирует `server`, `dns_servers` и все runtime keys, чтобы новый parser
  key нельзя было добавить без теста его сохраняемого представления.
- `install-polkit` и `set-service-user` валидируют unit/account до использования в path/policy,
  атомарно пишут rule/drop-in с явными правами и проверяют `chmod`, `chown` и
  `systemctl daemon-reload`. При возврате с root владение `/etc/qeli` исправляется до удаления
  последнего рабочего root override.
- Панель показывает hostname текущего сервера рядом с версией, а UDP-индикаторы теперь явно
  различают ёмкость очереди и заполнение сокетного буфера. Административный доступ проверяется
  реальным запросом `pkcheck`, а не чтением системных polkit rules, обычно недоступных сервисному
  пользователю; отсутствие helper или неопределённый результат не показываются как подтверждённый
  запрет.
- Удаление client-профиля через panel сначала обязано остановить процесс и удалить основной файл;
  сбой очистки log/status возвращается warning. Ошибки сериализации notification config и создания
  каталога web TLS больше не выглядят успешной записью или запуском.

### Фрейминг, инкапсуляция и wire-совместимость

- Native FFI отклоняет null pointer с положительной длиной. EOF внутри TLS record является
  `UnexpectedEof`, а не корректным завершением потока.
- Rust, retained C# и Swift требуют точного полного потребления AEAD record. Корректный
  аутентифицированный префикс с неаутентифицированным хвостом отклоняется; in-place destination
  очищается при любой ошибке decode.
- UDP handshake проверяет record length и overflow до PQ/TLS key schedule; truncated
  ChangeCipherSpec, Certificate, Finished и NewSessionTicket не выводят offset за datagram.
- TCP/sans-IO handshake также требует ожидаемые ChangeCipherSpec и NewSessionTicket. Ошибки
  certificate generation, TLS 1.3 и session ticketer возвращаются из REALITY setup вместо panic;
  IPv6 decoy endpoint собирается общим host/port helper.
- Новый QUIC masking отправляет точный Initial `0xC3`. Parser проверяет version 1, DCID 4 bytes,
  пустые SCID/token, Length, packet number 4 bytes, short flags и полное потребление datagram.
  Для rolling upgrade принимается только точная legacy-форма `0xE3`; произвольный type, битый
  varint и trailing bytes отклоняются.
- Сервер выбирает режим тем же полным structural parser, а не проверкой префикса. Общие fixtures
  синхронизируют Rust, C# и Swift для packet decode, QUIC, fragmentation, replay, PRP nonce и HKDF.
- Документация больше не выдаёт masking за полный QUIC: Initial AEAD, header protection, CRYPTO
  frames и padding Initial до 1200 bytes не реализованы.

### Сборка и release hygiene

- `DELIBERATE_CYCLE` определён на всех targets, что устранило Android E0425. Финальные Windows x64,
  macOS universal2 и Android arm64-v8a/x86_64 cores пересобраны двумя независимыми A/B-проходами с
  побайтно одинаковым результатом и обновлённым provenance.
- После hardening восстановлены Rust build/format/lints. Teardown test ждёт реального Drop и
  выполняется последовательно, исключая ложную ошибку от повторного номера raw fd.
- Keenetic helpers определяют checkout от своего script path, native recipe tests проверяют это, а
  ошибка helper сохраняет ненулевой exit code.
- Четыре устаревших однохостовых deploy/link-скрипта, перезаписывавших live-конфиг либо
  использовавших фиксированный пример credential, завершаются до любого SSH import/connect.
- Server installer выбирает `.deb` по Debian-архитектуре хоста, проверяет package metadata и для
  явно переданных файлов/URL и добавляет временные package/checksum-файлы в cleanup trap.
- Временные round-trip snippets удалены из `release/`, версии и build numbers синхронизированы во
  всём дереве исходников.
- Version gate охватывает подписанное macOS per-app extension, а IPv4/DNS diagnostics получают
  номер из `CARGO_PKG_VERSION` вместо hardcode предыдущего релиза.
- Dependency baseline переведён на полный набор Avalonia `11.3.20` для macOS, Windows service
  packages `.NET 10.0.11`, stable AppCompat `1.8.0`, Gradle `9.7.0`, подписанный
  wrapper-validation action `v6.3.0` и patch-обновления rcgen, serde_json, socket2, clap и
  thiserror в Rust lockfile. Поскольку `Cargo.lock` входит в native source digest, cores повторно
  собраны из clean commit `b1e220d` независимыми A/B-проходами на лабах `.10`/`.11`; canonical и
  consumed copies, hashes, evidence и provenance согласованы с source digest
  `85d7163bd1f2632077070cd3706ceb49993cc13b21671353ab225161aef4e7e7`.
- Android release sync теперь передаёт pinned wrapper JAR и оба launcher script как build inputs, а
  не только `gradle-wrapper.properties`. После однократного заполнения кэша Gradle `9.7.0`
  подписанный APK `719` / `0.7.16` прошёл clean unit tests, lint, R8 и сборку полностью offline.
- Lab-helper `fmt_clippy.py push` теперь создаёт отсутствующие удалённые каталоги и синхронизирует
  полный Git-tracked набор Rust build inputs, включая `Cargo.lock`, web templates/fonts, config,
  conformance и `deny.toml`: Clippy/tests больше не зависят от неполного или старого дерева на лабе.
- Транзитивная зависимость `h2` обновлена с `0.4.15` до `0.4.16`, устраняя
  `RUSTSEC-2026-0258` (неограниченный поток пустых HTTP/2 DATA frames); финальный dependency graph
  проходит `cargo audit` без уязвимостей.
- `qeli-linux-amd64` и `qeli_0.7.16_amd64.deb` пересобраны из source baseline `b1e220d`; полный lab
  gate прошёл, включая 635 library tests и 8 CLI/config tests, formatting, Clippy,
  fuzz/conformance, cargo-deny и ABI-проверку portable-сборки с glibc 2.28.

## Release verification · Проверка релиза

The candidate in `release/dist/v0.7.16` contains 16 payloads rebuilt after Rust/native source
baseline `b1e220d` and the platform changes through `24e71f7`: reproducible native cores; a signed
Android Release APK (`719` / `0.7.16`); Windows self-test and packetbench builds; a two-architecture ad-hoc
signed macOS bundle; Linux portable and byte-matching Debian binaries; four OpenWrt and two Keenetic
clients. Matching OpenWrt/Keenetic architectures are intentionally byte-identical. The OpenWrt feed
pins `b1e220d`; SDK 23.05.5 generated and reverified the canonical source archive with mirror hash
`16d31f7cedadf9aac870d8c398845f242c0a4847ccc4239de7ec114b99084c32`.

Кандидат в `release/dist/v0.7.16` содержит 16 payload-файлов, пересобранных после Rust/native source
baseline `b1e220d` и platform-изменений по `24e71f7`: воспроизводимые native cores; подписанный
Android Release APK (`719` / `0.7.16`); Windows-сборки с self-test и packetbench; двухархитектурный ad-hoc signed macOS
bundle; Linux portable и побайтно совпадающий с ним бинарник внутри Debian-пакета; четыре OpenWrt и
два Keenetic client. Соответствующие архитектуры OpenWrt/Keenetic намеренно побайтно совпадают.
OpenWrt feed закреплён на `b1e220d`; SDK 23.05.5 сформировал и повторно проверил canonical source
archive с mirror hash `16d31f7cedadf9aac870d8c398845f242c0a4847ccc4239de7ec114b99084c32`.

The production all-modes and Android roaming/sleep lifecycle matrix was not rerun while preparing
this release because it temporarily changes the production profile set and restarts the service.
Run it only in an explicitly authorised maintenance window.

Production all-modes и Android roaming/sleep lifecycle matrix при подготовке релиза не запускались:
проверка временно меняет набор production profiles и перезапускает сервис. Её следует выполнять
только в отдельно согласованное окно обслуживания.
