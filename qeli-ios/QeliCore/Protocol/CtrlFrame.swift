///
/// Why in-tunnel: the one thing that needs sending — the tunnel MTU this client settled on — is
/// only known AFTER the handshake (on UDP it comes out of the path-MTU probe), so no handshake
/// field can carry it. Riding inside the tunnel also means the frame inherits the session's AEAD
/// and replay protection, instead of being a bare datagram whose only identity is a source
/// address anyone could spoof.
///
/// Wire: `[0xC1][0x9B][type(1)][len(1)][body(len)]`. The tunnel's plaintext is otherwise an IP
/// packet (or empty, for the heartbeat); `0xC1`'s high nibble is `0xC`, which is neither 4 nor 6,
/// so a control frame can never be confused with IPv4/IPv6 in either direction.
///
/// Additive: a server that predates this has no branch for the frame and discards it as a
/// malformed packet, keeping its profile MTU — exactly its old behaviour. Nothing waits for a
/// reply.
